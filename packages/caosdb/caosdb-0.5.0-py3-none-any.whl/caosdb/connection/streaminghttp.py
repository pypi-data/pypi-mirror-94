"""Streaming HTTP uploads module.

This module extends the standard httplib and http.client HTTPConnection so that
iterable objects can be used in the body of HTTP requests.

**N.B.** You must specify a Content-Length header if using an iterable object
since there is no way to determine in advance the total size that will be
yielded, and there is no way to reset an interator.
