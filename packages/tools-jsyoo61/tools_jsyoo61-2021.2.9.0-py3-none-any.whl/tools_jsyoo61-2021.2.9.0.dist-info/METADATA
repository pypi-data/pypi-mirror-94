# tools-jsyoo61

My personal tools for python programming.\

    pip install tools-jsyoo61

    from tools import load_pickle, save_pickle, path, tdict

Most useful functions are in `tools.tools`\
API dependent tools are in their corresponding folders: `tools.API_name` (i.e. `tools.torch.optim`)

`scripts/` folder is not included in pip. It's just a copy-paste format

I'm open to using my tools for any purpose, and I would appreciate it if the users let me know.
Please email me before using it.

If you have any questions or suggestions, I am more than happy to discuss them :smile: \
Please contact me via email or pull request. (I prefer email though)
