        # Amphetype: Resurrected
        
        Amphetype is an advanced typing practice program.
        
        It gives the basic statistics like WPM (words per minute) and
        accuracy, as well as identifies the keys/trigrams/words that break up
        your flow, and what an impact these "viscous" combinations have on
        your typing speed overall.
        
        Features include:
        
        * Entirely and deliberatly layout-agnostic.
        
          Amphetype doesn't care _what_ keyboard or layout you use, it only
          looks at _how_ you use it. As such it's likely not suitable for
          complete typing beginners who need an on-screen keyboard.
        
        * Type your favorite novel!
        
          One of the ideas behind Amphetype was to not just use boring "stock
          texts," but to allow me to type texts I actually want to read as well.
          So a core feature is the ability to import whole novels (for example
          from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)) and have
          Amphetype automatically generate bite-sized lessons from the text.
          When I was learning the [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) keyboard
          layout, I typed (and thus read) the entire _Metamorphosis_ by Franz
          Kafka!
          
        * Generate lessons from past statistics.
        
          Amphetype features an advanced lesson generator where you can
          generate texts based on your past performance. Generate blocks of
          text to target practice your slowest words, trigrams, or keys!
        
        * Highly customizable with regard to look and feel.
        
        # Installing
        
        **TODO**
        
        I'll make actual installation packages. For now, the hard way:
        
        Install dependencies:
        ``` bash
        $ pip install translitcodec PyQt5
        ```
        
        Run:
        
        ``` bash
        $ python Amphetype.py
        ```
        
        # Resurrected?
        
        Yes, I originally made this program 12 years ago
        [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/). I've updated it
        somewhat, included some features that were requested back then, and
        upgraded the code to use Python 3 and Qt5 (instead of Python 2 and
        Qt4).
