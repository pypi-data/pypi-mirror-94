# Python Version Support Statement

This project has been around for a while.  Previously, it supported all the way back to before 2.5.  Currently py-lmdb
supports Python 2.7, Python >= 3.5, and pypy.

Python 2.7 is now end-of-life.  If you are still using Python 2.7, you should strongly considering porting to Python
3.

That said, this project will continue to support running on Python 2.7 until Github Actions remove support for it.

# Sponsored by The Vertex Project
