        long_description = '\nMpcurses is an abstraction of the Python curses and multiprocessing libraries providing function execution and runtime visualization capabilities at scale. It contains a simple API to enable any Python function to be executed across one or more background processes and includes built-in directives to visualize the functions execution on a terminal screen. \nThe mpcurses API allows for seamless integration since it does not require the target function to include additional context about curses or multiprocessing. The target function does need to implement logging since log messages are the primary means of inter-process communication between the background processes executing the function and the main process updating the curses screen on the terminal.\nFor examples checkout our home page: https://github.com/soda480/mpcurses\n',
