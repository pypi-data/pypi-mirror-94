Documentation
=============

Documentation can be found on readthedocs_.

Installation
============

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install dungeonsheets

.. note::

   Dungeon sheets requires **at least python 3.6**. This is mostly due
   to the liberal use of f-strings_. If you want to use it with
   previous versions of python 3, you'll probably have to replace all
   the f-strings with the older ``.format()`` method or string
   interpolation.

.. _f-strings: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/

Optional External dependencies
==============================

* You may use **pdftk** to generate the sheets in PDF format.
* You will need **pdflatex** installed to generate the PDF spell pages (optional).

If **pdftk** is available, it will be used for pdf generation. If not,
a fallback python library (pdfrw) will be used. This has some
limitations:

- Produces v1.3 PDF files
- Not able to flatten PDF forms
- Will produce separate character-sheets, spell-lists and spell-books.
  
Different linux distributions have different names for packages. While
pdftk is available in Debian and derivatives as **pdftk**, the package
is not available in some RPM distributions, such as Fedora and CentOS.
One alternative would be to build your PC sheets using docker.

If the ``pdflatex`` command is available on your system, spellcasters
will include a spellbook with descriptions of each spell known. If
not, then this feature will be skipped.

Usage
=====

Each character is described by a python (or a VTTES JSON) file, which
gives many attributes associated with the character. See examples_ for
more information about the character descriptions.

.. _examples: https://github.com/canismarko/dungeon-sheets/tree/master/examples

The PDF's can then be generated using the ``makesheets`` command. If
no filename is given, the current directory will be parsed and any
character files found will be processed. If the ``--recursive`` option
is used, sub-folders will also be parsed.

.. code:: bash

    $ cd examples
    $ makesheets

dungeon-sheets contains definitions for standard weapons and spells,
so attack bonuses and damage can be calculated automatically.

If you have the excellent *dndbook* LaTeX template, consider using the
``-F`` option to include this template for rendering spellbooks, druid
wild forms and features pages:

If you'd like a **step-by-step walkthrough** for creating a new
character, just run ``create-character`` from a command line and a
helpful menu system will take care of the basics for you.


Content Descriptions
====================

The descriptions of content elements (e.g. classes, spells, etc.) are
included in docstrings. The descriptions should ideally conform to
reStructured text. This allows certain formatting elements to be
properly parsed and rendered into LaTeX::

  class Scrying(Spell):
    """You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on
    the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a W isdom
    saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target
    and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target
    knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw
    voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

    Knowledge - Save Modifier
    -------------------------
    - Secondhand (you have heard of the target) - +5
    - Firsthand (you have met the target) - +0
    - Familiar (you know the target well) - -5

    Connection - Save Modifier
    --------------------------
    - Likeness or picture - -2
    - Possession or garment - -4
    - Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like - -10

    """
