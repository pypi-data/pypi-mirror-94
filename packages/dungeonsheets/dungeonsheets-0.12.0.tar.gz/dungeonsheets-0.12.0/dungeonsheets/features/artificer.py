    died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to
    revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot
    of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute
    with all its hit points restored.

    At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have
    your smith's tools with you. If you already have a steel defender from this
    feature, the first one immediately perishes.
