    The behavior of the ``ironic-boot-configuration`` validations has changed
    substantially in acknowledgment that deploy images may or may not be
    Glance images. The new validatoin logic is more generalized than before,
    in that now it checks that the deploy images associated to the nodes of a
    certain arch/platform do not exceed a certain standard of diversity.
