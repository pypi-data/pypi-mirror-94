    The behavior of the ``ironic-boot-configuration`` validation has changed
    in order to suppport multi-arch. It now checks that each node has the
    correct associated ramdisk and kernel image according to the node's
    architecture and platform, and, when it does appear that the correct image
    is associated, checks that there is only one image in Glance with that
    name. Also, the vars ``deploy_kernel_name`` and ``deploy_ramdisk_name``
    have changed to ``deploy_kernel_name_base`` and
    ``deploy_ramdisk_name_base`` respectively.

    The ``deployment-images`` validation has been removed, as its intended
    functionality became inseparable from ``ironic-boot-configuration`` in the
    multi-arch case.
