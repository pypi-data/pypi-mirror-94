    Validate that there are no volumes formatted with XFS
    and ftype=0.
    Deployments from OpenStack Kilo or Liberty have XFS
    partitions formatted with ftype=0, which is incompatible
    with the docker overlayfs driver.
    From OpenStack Newton, we have support for XFS ftype=1
    by default.
    This check will make fail the pre-upgrade validations
    if there are deployments coming back from Kilo or Liberty
    and have XFS partitions with ftype=0.
