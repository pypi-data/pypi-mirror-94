  name: Events Database Size Check
  description: >
    The undercloud's events database can grow to a substantial
    size if event_time_to_live is set to a negative value (infinite limit).

    This validation checks event_time_to_live and fails if the variable is
    set to a negative value or if it has no custom setting
    (their value is -1 by default).
  groups:
    - pre-deployment
