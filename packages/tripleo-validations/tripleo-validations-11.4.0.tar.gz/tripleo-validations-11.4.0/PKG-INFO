        TripleO Validations
        ===================
        
        A collection of Ansible roles and playbooks to detect and report potential
        issues during TripleO deployments.
        
        The validations will help detect issues early in the deployment process and
        prevent field engineers from wasting time on misconfiguration or hardware
        issues in their environments.
        
        All validations are written in Ansible and are written in a way that's
        consumable by the `Mistral validation framework
        <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/255792/>`_ or by Ansible directly. They are
        available independently from the UI or the command line client.
