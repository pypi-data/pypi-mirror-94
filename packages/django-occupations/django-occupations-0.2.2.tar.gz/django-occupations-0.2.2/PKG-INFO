        django-occupations is a reusable Django App for importing, updating, and managing structured occupation data.
        
        
        Overview
        ------------------------
        
        The structure of this data is currently based primarily on the US Federal Government's Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system, but in the future we aspire to support other structured occupation sources. The US Federal Government's Office of Management and Budget is responsible for maintaining the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. For more information on SOC, please visit https://www.bls.gov/soc/ or https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_2018_manual.pdf or https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_2018_definitions.pdf and https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_structure_2018.pdf 
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "django_occupations" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'django_occupations',
            ]
        
        2. Include the django-occupations URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            path('occupations/', include('django_occupations.urls')),
        
        3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the django-occupations models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to view or edit occupation data (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        
        Roadmap
        -------------
        - Update documentation
        - Add model relationships
        - Add slug fields for URLs
        - Add test coverage
        - Add management command to pull the latest SOC data
        - Add latest SOC data to version control and add a migration to populate data from SOC data
        - Add management command to update SOC Direct Match Titles
        - Decide how to handle when SOC *removes* certain occupations? Merge into others? Orphan them? Note the date they were deprecated?
        - Clean up some lingering references to edX that no longer make sense (this repo was set up using an edX-authored cookiecutter https://github.com/edx/edx-cookiecutters/tree/master/cookiecutter-django-app )
        
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        (TODO: Set up documentation)
        
        ## Data Policy
        We use SOC 6-digit codes, but omit the hypen that SOC puts between the 2nd and 3rd digit
        
        
        For Maintainers
        ---------------
        
        To publish a new release:
        1. Update the version number in the application module's __init__.py file, update CHANGELOG.rst accordingly, and run ``python setup.py tag``
        2. Generate distributions using ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`` (based on the instructions at https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives)
        3. Use twine to update PyPi with ``python -m twine upload dist/*``
