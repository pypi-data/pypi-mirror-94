# Airplane Python SDK ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/airplanesdk) ![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/airplanesdk)

An SDK for writing Airplane tasks in Python.

## Usage

First, install the SDK:

```sh
pip install airplane
```

Next, you can use the SDK to produce outputs which will be separated from your logs:

```python
import airplane

airplane.writeOutput("Show me what you got")

# You can also separate outputs into groups by attaching names:
airplane.writeNamedOutput("saying", "Show me what you got")
airplane.writeNamedOutput("saying", "Welcome to the club, pal")
airplane.writeNamedOutput("name", "Summer")
```

This SDK can be used to programmatically kick off tasks and fetch their output:

```python
# You can get a task's ID from the URL bar, f.e.
# https://app.airplane.dev/tasks/1oMt2mZC1DjkOZXxHH8BV57xrmF
taskId = "..."
runOutput = airplane.run(taskId, {
  # Optionally provide parameters to your task, using the same name
  # as when templating a parameter into your task's CLI args.
  "DryRun": True,
})
# run() will return a dict of outputs, by name.
# Default outputs are available as `runOutput.output`.
print(runOutput)
```
