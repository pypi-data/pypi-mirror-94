class EntityItemIpaddressStringTypeDatatype(Enum):
    """
    :cvar BINARY: The binary datatype is used to represent hex-encoded
        data that is in raw (non-printable) form. This datatype conforms
        to the W3C Recommendation for binary data meaning that each
        binary octet is encoded as a character tuple, consisting of two
        hexadecimal digits {[0-9a-fA-F]} representing the octet code.
        Expected operations within OVAL for binary values are 'equals'
        and 'not equal'.
    :cvar BOOLEAN: The boolean datatype represents standard boolean
        data, either true or false.  This datatype conforms to the W3C
        Recommendation for boolean data meaning that the following
        literals are legal values: {true, false, 1, 0}.  Expected
        operations within OVAL for boolean values are 'equals' and 'not
        equal'.
    :cvar EVR_STRING: The evr_string datatype represents the epoch,
        version, and release fields as a single version string. It has
        the form "EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE". Comparisons involving this
        datatype should follow the algorithm of librpm's rpmvercmp()
        function. Expected operations within OVAL for evr_string values
        are 'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or
        equal', 'less than', and 'less than or equal'.
    :cvar DEBIAN_EVR_STRING: The debian_evr_string datatype represents
        the epoch, upstream_version, and debian_revision fields, for a
        Debian package, as a single version string. It has the form
        "EPOCH:UPSTREAM_VERSION-DEBIAN_REVISION". Comparisons involving
        this datatype should follow the algorithm outlined in Chapter 5
        of the "Debian Policy Manual"
        (https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-
        controlfields.html#s-f-Version). Note that a null epoch is
        equivalent to a value of '0'. An implementation of this is the
        cmpversions() function in dpkg's enquiry.c. Expected operations
        within OVAL for debian_evr_string values are 'equals', 'not
        equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or equal', 'less than',
        and 'less than or equal'.
    :cvar FILESET_REVISION: The fileset_revision datatype represents the
        version string related to filesets in HP-UX. An example would be
        'A.03.61.00'. For more information, see the HP-UX "Software
        Distributor Administration Guide"
        (http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c01919399/c01919399.pdf).
        Expected operations within OVAL for fileset_version values are
        'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or equal',
        'less than', and 'less than or equal'.
    :cvar FLOAT_VALUE: The float datatype describes standard float data.
        This datatype conforms to the W3C Recommendation for float data
        meaning it is patterned after the IEEE single-precision 32-bit
        floating point type.  The format consists of a decimal followed,
        optionally, by the character 'E' or 'e', followed by an integer
        exponent.  The special values positive and negative infinity and
        not-a-number have are represented by INF, -INF and NaN,
        respectively.  Expected operations within OVAL for float values
        are 'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or
        equal', 'less than', and 'less than or equal'.
    :cvar IOS_VERSION: The ios_version datatype describes Cisco IOS
        Train strings. These are in essence version strings for IOS.
        Please refer to Cisco's IOS Reference Guide for information on
        how to compare different Trains as they follow a very specific
        pattern. Expected operations within OVAL for ios_version values
        are 'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or
        equal', 'less than', and 'less than or equal'.
    :cvar INT_VALUE: The int datatype describes standard integer data.
        This datatype conforms to the W3C Recommendation for integer
        data which follows the standard mathematical concept of the
        integer numbers.  (no decimal point and infinite range)
        Expected operations within OVAL for int values are 'equals',
        'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or equal', 'less
        than', 'less than or equal', 'bitwise and', and 'bitwise or'.
    :cvar IPV4_ADDRESS:
    :cvar IPV6_ADDRESS:
    :cvar STRING:
    :cvar VERSION: The version datatype represents a value that is a
        hierarchical list of non-negative integers separated by a single
        character delimiter.  Note that any non-number character can be
        used as a delimiter and that different characters can be used
        within the same version string.  So '#.#-#' is the same as
        '#.#.#' or '#c#c#' where '#' is any non-negative integer.
        Expected operations within OVAL for version values are 'equals',
        'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or equal', 'less
        than', and 'less than or equal'. For example '#.#.#' or
        '#-#-#-#' where the numbers to the left are more significant
        than the numbers to the right. When performing an 'equals'
        operation on a version datatype, you should first check the left
        most number for equality. If that fails, then the values are not
        equal. If it succeeds, then check the second left most number
        for equality. Continue checking the numbers from left to right
        until the last number has been checked. If, after testing all
        the previous numbers, the last number is equal then the two
        versions are equal. When performing other operations, such as
        'less than', 'less than or equal', 'greater than, or 'greater
        than or equal', similar logic as above is used. Start with the
        left most number and move from left to right. For each number,
        check if it is less than the number you are testing against. If
        it is, then the version in question is less than the version you
        are testing against. If the number is equal, then move to check
        the next number to the right. For example, to test if 5.7.23 is
        less than or equal to 5.8.0 you first compare 5 to 5. They are
        equal so you move on to compare 7 to 8. 7 is less than 8 so the
        entire test succeeds and 5.7.23 is 'less than or equal' to
        5.8.0. The difference between the 'less than' and 'less than or
        equal' operations is how the last number is handled. If the last
        number is reached, the check should use the given operation
        (either 'less than' and 'less than or equal') to test the
        number. For example, to test if 4.23.6 is greater than 4.23.6
        you first compare 4 to 4. They are equal so you move on to
        compare 23 to 23. They are equal so you move on to compare 6 to
        6. This is the last number in the version and since 6 is not
        greater than 6, the entire test fails and 4.23.6 is not greater
        than 4.23.6. Version strings with a different number of
        components shall be padded with zeros to make them the same
        size. For example, if the version strings '1.2.3' and '6.7.8.9'
        are being compared, then the short one should be padded to
        become '1.2.3.0'.

class FlagEnumeration(Enum):
    """The FlagEnumeration simple type defines the valid flags associated with
    a collected object.

    These flags are meant to provide information about how the specified
    object was handled by the data collector. In order to evaluate an
    OVAL Definition, information about the defined objects needs to be
    available. The flags help detail the outcome of attempting to
    collect information related to these objects..

    :cvar ERROR: A flag of 'error' indicates that there was an error
        trying to identify items on the system that match the specified
        object declaration. This flag is not meant to be used when there
        was an error retrieving a specific entity, but rather when it
        could not be determined if an item exists or not. Any error in
        retrieving a specific entity should be represented by setting
        the status of that specific entity to 'error'.
    :cvar COMPLETE: A flag of 'complete' indicates that every matching
        item on the system has been identified and is represented in the
        system characteristics file. It can be assumed that no
        additional matching items exist on the system.
    :cvar INCOMPLETE: A flag of 'incomplete' indicates that a matching
        item exists on the system, but only some of the matching items
        have been identified and are represented in the system
        characteristics file. It is unknown if additional matching items
        also exist. Note that with a flag of 'incomplete', each item
        that has been identified  matches the object declaration, but
        additional items might also exist on the system.
    :cvar DOES_NOT_EXIST: A flag of 'does not exist' indicates that the
        underlying structure is installed on the system but no matching
        item was found. For example, the Windows metabase is installed
        but there were no items that matched the metabase_object. In
        this example, if the metabase itself was not installed, then the
        flag would have been 'not applicable'.
    :cvar NOT_COLLECTED: A flag of 'not collected' indicates that no
        attempt was made to collect items on the system. An object with
        this flag will produce an 'unknown' result during analysis since
        it is unknown if matching items exists on the system or not.
        This is different from an 'error' flag because an 'error' flag
        indicates that an attempt was made to collect items on system
        whereas a 'not collected' flag indicates that an attempt was not
        made to collect items on the system.
    :cvar NOT_APPLICABLE: A flag of 'not applicable' indicates that the
        specified object is not applicable to the system being
        characterized. This could be because the data repository is not
        installed or that the object structure is for a different flavor
        of systems. An example would be trying to collect objects
        related to a Red Hat system off of a Windows system. Another
        example would be trying to collect an rpminfo_object on a Linux
        system if the rpm packaging system is not installed. If the rpm
        packaging system is installed and the specified rpminfo_object
        could not be found, then the flag would be 'does not exist'.

        """
        :cvar BINARY: The binary datatype is used to represent hex-
            encoded data that is in raw (non-printable) form. This
            datatype conforms to the W3C Recommendation for binary data
            meaning that each binary octet is encoded as a character
            tuple, consisting of two hexadecimal digits {[0-9a-fA-F]}
            representing the octet code.  Expected operations within
            OVAL for binary values are 'equals' and 'not equal'.
        :cvar BOOLEAN: The boolean datatype represents standard boolean
            data, either true or false.  This datatype conforms to the
            W3C Recommendation for boolean data meaning that the
            following literals are legal values: {true, false, 1, 0}.
            Expected operations within OVAL for boolean values are
            'equals' and 'not equal'.
        :cvar EVR_STRING: The evr_string datatype represents the epoch,
            version, and release fields as a single version string. It
            has the form "EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE". Comparisons involving
            this datatype should follow the algorithm of librpm's
            rpmvercmp() function. Expected operations within OVAL for
            evr_string values are 'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than',
            'greater than or equal', 'less than', and 'less than or
            equal'.
        :cvar DEBIAN_EVR_STRING: The debian_evr_string datatype
            represents the epoch, upstream_version, and debian_revision
            fields, for a Debian package, as a single version string. It
            has the form "EPOCH:UPSTREAM_VERSION-DEBIAN_REVISION".
            Comparisons involving this datatype should follow the
            algorithm outlined in Chapter 5 of the "Debian Policy
            Manual" (https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-
            controlfields.html#s-f-Version). Note that a null epoch is
            equivalent to a value of '0'. An implementation of this is
            the cmpversions() function in dpkg's enquiry.c. Expected
            operations within OVAL for debian_evr_string values are
            'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or
            equal', 'less than', and 'less than or equal'.
        :cvar FILESET_REVISION: The fileset_revision datatype represents
            the version string related to filesets in HP-UX. An example
            would be 'A.03.61.00'. For more information, see the HP-UX
            "Software Distributor Administration Guide"
            (http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c01919399/c01919399.pdf).
            Expected operations within OVAL for fileset_version values
            are 'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or
            equal', 'less than', and 'less than or equal'.
        :cvar FLOAT_VALUE: The float datatype describes standard float
            data.  This datatype conforms to the W3C Recommendation for
            float data meaning it is patterned after the IEEE single-
            precision 32-bit floating point type.  The format consists
            of a decimal followed, optionally, by the character 'E' or
            'e', followed by an integer exponent.  The special values
            positive and negative infinity and not-a-number have are
            represented by INF, -INF and NaN, respectively.  Expected
            operations within OVAL for float values are 'equals', 'not
            equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or equal', 'less
            than', and 'less than or equal'.
        :cvar IOS_VERSION: The ios_version datatype describes Cisco IOS
            Train strings. These are in essence version strings for IOS.
            Please refer to Cisco's IOS Reference Guide for information
            on how to compare different Trains as they follow a very
            specific pattern. Expected operations within OVAL for
            ios_version values are 'equals', 'not equal', 'greater
            than', 'greater than or equal', 'less than', and 'less than
            or equal'.
        :cvar INT_VALUE: The int datatype describes standard integer
            data.  This datatype conforms to the W3C Recommendation for
            integer data which follows the standard mathematical concept
            of the integer numbers.  (no decimal point and infinite
            range)  Expected operations within OVAL for int values are
            'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than', 'greater than or
            equal', 'less than', 'less than or equal', 'bitwise and',
            and 'bitwise or'.
        :cvar IPV4_ADDRESS:
        :cvar IPV6_ADDRESS:
        :cvar STRING: The string datatype describes standard string
            data. This datatype conforms to the W3C Recommendation for
            string data.  Expected operations within OVAL for string
            values are 'equals', 'not equal', 'case insensitive equals',
            'case insensitive not equal', 'pattern match'.
        :cvar VERSION: The version datatype represents a value that is a
            hierarchical list of non-negative integers separated by a
            single character delimiter.  Note that any non-number
            character can be used as a delimiter and that different
            characters can be used within the same version string.  So
            '#.#-#' is the same as '#.#.#' or '#c#c#' where '#' is any
            non-negative integer.  Expected operations within OVAL for
            version values are 'equals', 'not equal', 'greater than',
            'greater than or equal', 'less than', and 'less than or
            equal'. For example '#.#.#' or '#-#-#-#' where the numbers
            to the left are more significant than the numbers to the
            right. When performing an 'equals' operation on a version
            datatype, you should first check the left most number for
            equality. If that fails, then the values are not equal. If
            it succeeds, then check the second left most number for
            equality. Continue checking the numbers from left to right
            until the last number has been checked. If, after testing
            all the previous numbers, the last number is equal then the
            two versions are equal. When performing other operations,
            such as 'less than', 'less than or equal', 'greater than, or
            'greater than or equal', similar logic as above is used.
            Start with the left most number and move from left to right.
            For each number, check if it is less than the number you are
            testing against. If it is, then the version in question is
            less than the version you are testing against. If the number
            is equal, then move to check the next number to the right.
            For example, to test if 5.7.23 is less than or equal to
            5.8.0 you first compare 5 to 5. They are equal so you move
            on to compare 7 to 8. 7 is less than 8 so the entire test
            succeeds and 5.7.23 is 'less than or equal' to 5.8.0. The
            difference between the 'less than' and 'less than or equal'
            operations is how the last number is handled. If the last
            number is reached, the check should use the given operation
            (either 'less than' and 'less than or equal') to test the
            number. For example, to test if 4.23.6 is greater than
            4.23.6 you first compare 4 to 4. They are equal so you move
            on to compare 23 to 23. They are equal so you move on to
            compare 6 to 6. This is the last number in the version and
            since 6 is not greater than 6, the entire test fails and
            4.23.6 is not greater than 4.23.6. Version strings with a
            different number of components shall be padded with zeros to
            make them the same size. For example, if the version strings
            '1.2.3' and '6.7.8.9' are being compared, then the short one
            should be padded to become '1.2.3.0'.

    The required id attribute is a unique (to the file) identifier that
    allows the specific item to be referenced. The required status
    attribute holds information regarding the success of the data
    collection. For example, if an item exists on the system then the
    status would reflect this with a value of 'exists'. If an error
    occurs which is not associated with any item entities, or if an
    error occurs that is associated with an item entity matching an
    associated object entity, then the status would be 'error'. An error
    specific to any particular entity should be addressed at the entity
    level and, for item entities not associated with an object entity,
    not the item level. When creating items, any entities that can
    successfully be collected should be reported. In some cases, when an
    item for a specified object does not exist, it may be beneficial to
    report a partial match of an item showing what entities did exist
    and what entities did not exist for debugging purposes. This is
    especially true when considering items that are collected by objects
    with hierarchical object entities. An example of such a case is when
    a file_object has a path entity equal to 'C:\' and a filename entity
    equal to 'test.txt' where 'test.txt' does not exist in the 'C:\'
    directory. This would result in the creation of a partially matching
    file_item with a status of 'does not exist' where the path entity
    equals 'C:\' and the filename entity equals 'test.txt' with a status
    of 'does not exist'. By showing the partial match, someone reading a
    system-characteristics document can quickly see that a matching
    file_item did not exist because the specified filename did not exist
    and not that the specified path did not exist. Again, please note
    that the implementation of partial matches, when an item for a
    specified object does not exist,  is completely optional.

    not exist'. For details on how to handle items, when an OVAL Object
    does not exist on the system, please see the ItemType documentation.
    This shows that the object was looked for but not found on the
    system. If no object element is written in this case, users of the
    system characteristics file will not know whether the object was not
    found or no attempt was made to collect it. The required id
    attribute is the id of the global OVAL Object. The required version
    attribute is the specific version of the global OVAL Object that was
    used by the data collection engine. The version is necessary so that
    analysis using a system characteristics file knows exactly what was
    collected. The optional variable_instance identifier is a unique id
    that differentiates each unique instance of an object. Capabilities
    that use OVAL may reference the same definition multiple times and
    provide different variable values each time the definition is
    referenced. This will result in multiple instances of an object
    being included in the OVAL System Characteristics file (definitions
    that do not use variables can only have one unique instance). The
    inclusion of this unique instance identifier allows the OVAL Results
    document to associate the correct objects and items for each
    combination of supplied values. The optional comment attribute
    provides a short description of the object. The required flag

        a different unique set of matching items depending on the value
        assigned to the variable. A tool that is given an OVAL System
        Characteristics file in order to analyze an OVAL Definition
        needs to be able to determine the exact instance of an object to
        use based on the variable values supplied. If a variable
        represents a collection of values, then multiple variable_value
        elements would exist with the same variable_id attribute.
    :ivar reference: The optional reference element links the collected
        item found by the data collection engine and the global OVAL
        Object. A global OVAL Object my have multiple matching items on
