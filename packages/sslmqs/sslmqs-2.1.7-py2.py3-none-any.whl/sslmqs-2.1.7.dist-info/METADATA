sslmqs is an abstraction layer above pika, used to connect to RabbitMQ cluster with SSL.

Its purpose is to manage the underlying connection, reconnect when a node of a cluster goes down, and provide the defaults for a situation where downtime should be minimized at all costs.

See also: `my article <https://blog.pelicandd.com/article/151/>`_ explaining the reason for this abstraction layer.
