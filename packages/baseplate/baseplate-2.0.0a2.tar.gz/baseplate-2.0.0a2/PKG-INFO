        It's much easier to manage a bunch of services when they all have the same
        shape: the way they're developed, the way they interact with the infrastructure
        they run on, and the way they interact with each other. Baseplate is reddit's
        specification for the common shape of our services. This library, Baseplate.py,
        is the Python implementation of that specification.
        
        Baseplate.py glues together tooling for interacting with the reddit backend
        ecosystem and spackles over things that are missing. It integrates with Apache
        Thrift, Pyramid, and client libraries for many systems to transparently make
        your applications observable.
        
        Baseplate applications transparently get:
        
        * Timing and request rate metrics using statsd
        * Distributed tracing with Zipkin
        * Error reporting and aggregation with Sentry
        
        And can take advantage of:
        
        * Integration with commonly used clients like: Thrift, SQLAlchemy,
          cassandra-driver, pymemcache, redis-py, and Kombu
        * Secrets securely pulled from Vault
        
        And many other things! Read the `full docs
        <https://baseplate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.
        
        Baseplate.py requires Python 3.7 or newer.
