This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.lt.asmens. It tries
to cover more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not really
useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.lt import asmens


>>> asmens.validate('36805280109')
'36805280109'
>>> asmens.validate('36813280103')  # invalid date
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> asmens.validate('36813280103', validate_birth_date=False)  # invalid date
'36813280103'
>>> asmens.validate('96813280109')  # invalid date but starts with a 9
'96813280109'
