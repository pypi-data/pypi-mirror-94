This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.ie.vat module. It
tries to cover more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.ie import vat


Extra tests for length checking and corner cases:

>>> vat.validate('111222333')  # check digits should be letters
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
>>> vat.validate('1234567ABC')  # too long
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...


The convert() function should leave invalid or already converted values
alone.

>>> vat.convert('IE8D79739I')
'0797398I'
>>> vat.convert('IE 632 3420 C')
'6323420C'
>>> vat.convert('123')
