        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The Watson Assistant Dialog Flow Analysis Notebook can help you assess
        and analyze user journeys and issues related to the dialog flow of
        ineffective (low quality) conversations based on production logs. The
        notebook can help you with questions such as: - What are the common
        conversation steps and flows within the assistant - Which flows have low
        task completion rates and high abandonment (ineffective conversations) -
        Where along the dialog steps users lose engagement with your assistant -
        What are common terms and steps that may lead to abandonment
        
        This notebook extends the `Measure and Analyze
        notebooks <https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook>`__
        by providing additional capabilities to assess and analyze effectiveness
        - focused more on issues related to the dialog flow. For more details,
        check out `IBM Watson Assistant Continuous Improvement Best
        Practices <https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook/raw/master/notebook/IBM%20Watson%20Assistant%20Continuous%20Improvement%20Best%20Practices.pdf>`__.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        The notebook requires a Jupyter Notebook environment and Python 3.6+.
        You can either install Jupyter Notebook to run locally or you can use
        Watson Studio on the cloud.
        
        Using Jupyter Notebook
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. Install Python 3.6+
        2. Install Jupyter notebook. Checkout the `Jupyter/IPython Notebook
           Quick Start
           Guide <https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__
           for more details
        3. Download the `notebooks/Dialog Flow Analysis
           Notebook.ipynb <https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-dialog-flow-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/Dialog%20Flow%20Analysis%20Notebook.ipynb>`__
           file.
        4. Start jupyter server ``jupyter notebook``
        5. Run the ``Dialog Flow Analysis Notebook.ipynb``
        
        Using Watson Studio
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. In Watson Studio, select ``Add to Project``-->``Notebook``. Choose
           ``From URL`` and paste this
           `url <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-dialog-flow-analysis/master/notebooks/Dialog%20Flow%20Analysis%20Notebook.ipynb>`__.
           Alternately you can select ``From file`` and upload the
           ``notebooks/Dialog Flow Analysis Notebook.ipynb`` file.
        
        Alternately, you can import and modify the `sample notebook on Watson
        Studio
