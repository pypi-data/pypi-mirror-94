CCStudio DSS
============

|PyPI| |Pythons| |Travis| |GitHub|

Build and load Code Composer Studio projects from the command line using the Java DSS library.

Presently this is in use with Python 3.7.  It likely works with other versions.  In general I am often willing to support as far as 2.7 and 3.4+.  There are no tests presently but we could likely make some leveraging the `altendky/docker-ccstudio8`_ repository.
