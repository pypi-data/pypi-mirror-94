Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

This repo exists to provide [an example setup.py] file, that can be used
to bootstrap your next Python project. It includes some advanced
patterns and best practices for `setup.py`, as well as some
commented–out nice–to–haves.

For example, this `setup.py` provides a `$ python setup.py upload`
command, which creates a *universal wheel* (and *sdist*) and uploads
your package to [PyPi] using [Twine], without the need for an annoying
`setup.cfg` file. It also creates/uploads a new git tag, automatically.

In short, `setup.py` files can be daunting to approach, when first
starting out — even Guido has been heard saying, "everyone cargo cults
thems". It's true — so, I want this repo to be the best place to
copy–paste from :)
