        Collection of recipes for running daylight studies using honeybee-radiance.
        
        Honeybee Radiance recipe library is a collection of recipes to automate the process of running lighting studies using [Radiance](http://radiance-online.org/).
        
        `honeybee-radiance-recipe` is built on top of [`honeybee-radiance`](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance). It uses [`radiance-folder-structure`](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/radiance-folder-structure) as the input for running recipes. As long as you follow the folder structure you should be able to use these recipes regardless of how the folder is generated. :rocket:
