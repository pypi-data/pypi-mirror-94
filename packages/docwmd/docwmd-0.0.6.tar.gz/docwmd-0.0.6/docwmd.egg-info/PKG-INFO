        ```
        pip install numpy
        pip install wmd
        pip install nltk
        pip install spacy
        python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
        ```
        
        Then
        ```

        ```
        Tested on Linux and macOS.
        
        **Usage**
        
        You must have the document you want to find the closest document as a string and the other documents as a list of strings.
        
        ```python
        from docwmd import docWMD
        
        calc = docWMD("Politician speaks to the media in Illinois.", ["The president greets the press in Chicago.", "The President delivers his inaugural address."])
        
        print(calc.get_closest())
        ```
        
        This returns the number of the nearest document and its distance.
