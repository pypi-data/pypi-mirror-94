// The following comments have deliberately been moved out of the macro to reduce the size of the generated file.

// The following code snippet is based on https://www.geekpub.de/2015/01/bootstrap-3-accordion-status-merken-mit-cookies/
// ad (1): The following handler creates a cookie if the accordion is not collapsed.

// ad (2): The following handler removes the cookie when the accordion is collapsed.
// In the following handler we have to make sure we only call the Cookies.remove method for the
// element by which the trigger was raised. In Bootstrap (or JavaScript?) there seems to be a mechanism which makes the event
// travel up the DOM tree so that the trigger handler is also called for enclosing accordions. This would lead to the cookies
// of whole path of accordions up the root be removed and hence to be collapsed.
// The correction is based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32070392/jquery-show-bs-collapse-event-for-nested-bootstrap-collapsible-buttons-fires-on

// ad (3): The following is executed when the page is loaded. It opens the accordion when a matching cookie is found.
