    [`bug 1888394 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.cache/+bug/1888394>`_]
    If a memcache server disappears and then reconnects when multiple memcache
    servers are used (specific to the python-memcached based backends) it is
    possible that the server will contain stale data. To avoid this, param
    flush_on_reconnect was used in code.

    But unfortunatelly this option is causing another issue.
    If memcache server disappears, or client had broken connection to memcache server,
    clients start to flush server on reconnect.

    This means that network connections will go UP and can cause server to be overloaded
    until memcache will be unresponsive.

    Simply said this option can cause loop of flushs and overloaded memcached servers.
    This change is moving optional parameter `flush_on_reconnect` to oslo.cache config.

features:
  - Configuration option ``memcache_pool_flush_on_reconnect`` added to control
    if flush will be sent to memcached server after reconnect.
