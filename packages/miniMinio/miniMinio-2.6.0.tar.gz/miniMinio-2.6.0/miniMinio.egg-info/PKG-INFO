Description: # miniMinio
        
        A thin python helper get either 1) local files or 2) Minio objects. 1) Heavily relies on the default os library while 2) is built off [minio-py](https://github.com/minio/minio-py). The package is designed to provide a seamless switch between testing file operations locally/over a file system and interacting with a minio server when in deployment.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install miniMinio.
        
        ```bash
        pip install miniMinio
        ```
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        ```python
        from miniMinio import Minio
        
        # For connecting to minio s3
        mc = Minio(type="minio").config(hostname='host',
                                        access_key='minio',
                                        secret_key='minio',
                                        secure=False
                                        )
        mc.ls('bucket/dir/')
        
        # For connecting to local filesystem
        mc = Minio(type="local").config()
        mc.ls('.')
        ```
