
evpy is a pyhton library used to predict efficiency in electric power trains given high level component specifications. It can be used to predict motor performance, a motors torque/speed/efficeiency contour, motor size given aspect ratio and torque, losses in an ESC given motor performance, ESC size, a batteryâ€™s voltage given time under a load, and battery mass given duration and specific energy.
