    In order to prevent wrong usage of the tree, implementing classes may throw
    UnsupportedOperationException if an operation is not supported. By default, all operations
    are supported, but some may not make sense in many situations.

    The goal of this is not reflect the change made to a IFileTree to the disk, but child
    classes may override relevant methods to do so.

    The tree is built upon FileTreeEntry. A given tree holds shared pointers to its entries
    while each entry holds a weak pointer to its parent, this means that the descending link
    are strong (shared pointers) but the uplink are weak.

    Accessing the parent is always done by locking the weak pointer so that returned pointer
    or either null or valid. This structure implies that as long as the initial root lives,
    entry should not be destroyed, unless the entry are detached from the root and no shared
    pointers are kept.

    However, it is not guarantee that one can go up the tree from a single node entry. If the
    root node is destroyed, it will not be possible to go up the tree, even if we still have
    a valid shared pointer.

    The ModDataContent feature is used (when available) to indicate to users the content
    of mods in the "Content" column.

    The feature exposes a list of possible content types, each associated with an ID, a name
    and an icon. The icon is the path to either:

      - A Qt resource or;
      - A file on the disk.

    In order to facilitate the implementation, MO2 already provides a set of icons that can
    be used. Those icons are all under ``:/MO/gui/content`` (e.g. ``:/MO/gui/content/plugin`` or ``:/MO/gui/content/music`` `).

    The list of available icons is:

      - ``plugin``: |plugin-icon|
