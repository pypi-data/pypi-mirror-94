An opinionated, forwards-looking Python template for 2021.

Generate elegant, ready-to-use Python
projects that have excellent continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Integrated with
Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, Azure, Conda-Forge, and an array of linting, static analysis,
security testing, documentation, dependency management, and CI/CD tools, including an optional
custom tool to keep all duplicate project metadata synchronized to pyproject.toml.

### 🎨 Design / generating a new project

This is a modern template built with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/),
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and
[no legacy files](https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/#-the-python-build-landscape) or tools.
See below for a [comparison to other tools](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyrannosaurus#-similar-templates-and-tools).
Also see Tyrannosaurus’’s little sister
[science-notebook-template 🧪](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/science-notebook-template)
for repos supporting scientific publications.

Don’t make 55 commits trying to configure CI/CD workflows.
After creating a new GitHub repository called `myproject`:

```bash
pip install tyrannosaurus
tyrannosaurus new myproject --track
```

If the repo is on an organization, pass `--user myorgname`.
After initializing your project, Tyrannosaurus will list manual steps like adding API keys.

### 💡 Main behavior / features

Generated projects are integrated with various tools (from PyPi) and external CI/CD/code-quality systems.
GitHub Actions are used by default, but config files for Travis and Azure Pipelines are also provided.
You can swap out, modify, or disable anything as you see fit.
**[See the docs 📚](https://tyrannosaurus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** for more information.

_By default_, here’s how your new project will behave:

- **Commit** ⇒ Files are linted and verified for integrity
- **Make a pull request** ⇒ Code is built and tested
- **Push to the main branch** ⇒ Code is built and tested; code quality, coverage, and security badges are updated
- **Make a GitHub release** ⇒ Artifacts are sent to GitHub, PyPi, DockerHub, GitHub Packages, and readthedocs
- `tox` ⇒ Tests are run locally
- `tyrannosaurus sync` ⇒ Project metadata is synced to pyproject.toml
- `tyrannosaurus update` ⇒ New dependency versions from PyPi and/or Conda are listed

† [Temporary issue in safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety/issues/201)

### ✏️ Syncing to pyproject.toml

_Note: This feature is only partly complete._

Tyrannosaurus has an optional `sync` command that synchronizes metadata from `pyproject.toml` to other files,
so that **all of your metadata is in pyproject.toml**.
There are 16 available target files, including `docs/conf.py`, `tox.ini`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `readthedocs.yml`,
`.travis.yml`, and `__init__.py`.
Settings like dev dependencies, project version, license headers, and preferred line length can be listed exactly once,
in pyproject.toml.

Tyrannosaurus itself can be included as a dependency (but is not by default).
Running `tyrannosaurus build` will run poetry lock, synchronize project metadata (via `sync`), build, run tests,
install, and clean up.
Target files can be disabled in `[tool.tyrannosaurus.targets]`.

### 🔨 Building your project locally

You can test your project locally. Install [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)
and [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (`pip install tox`).
Then just type `tox` to build artifacts and run tests.
You can install locally with `poetry install .` or just `pip install .`.
To create an initial Anaconda recipe or environment file, run `tyrannosaurus recipe` or `tyrannosaurus env`.
After that, you can use `sync` to keep them up-to-date with pyproject.toml.

### 🎯 Similar templates and tools

There are various other templates based on [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
and [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier). See which best suits your needs and style.

I designed Tyrannosaurus to solve issues with existing tools.
Here are features that other tools lack:

- An **elegant CI/CD workflow**: The workflow gets kicked off only via `git push` and GitHub releases.
- **Interopability with Conda**, including recipes and environment files, by mapping dependencies and metadata.
- **Automated publishing** to PyPi, Conda-Forge, Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, and readthedocs.
- **No duplication** between project files. (Not 100%: some duplication remains.)
- Built-in optional support for **extra/alternative tools**, such as Travis and codemeta.
- Complete **absence of legacy tools**, files, and Python 2 support.

**† _N int._**: Approximate number of built-in integrations with tools and standards. What counts is very roughly defined.  
**‡ _Modern_**: Lacks legacy files and tools. I’m including Make, setuptools, pipenv, and some others.  
**Note:** [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) syncs with a remote template. It’s a neat idea that Tyrannosaurus lacks.

Some of the packages in the table above need more explanation:

- [hypermodern-python](https://github.com/cjolowicz/hypermodern-python)
  ([template](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python)), a Poetry-powered Python
  template. It’s good, but it made a few unusual choices, such as [Nox](https://github.com/theacodes/nox), which has <500 GitHub stars.
- Both [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) and
  [django-init](https://github.com/Fueled/django-init) have fantastic setups for Django projects.
- [Cookiecutter-docker-science](https://github.com/docker-science/cookiecutter-docker-science) is an interesting project
  that doesn’t quite fit in this list.
