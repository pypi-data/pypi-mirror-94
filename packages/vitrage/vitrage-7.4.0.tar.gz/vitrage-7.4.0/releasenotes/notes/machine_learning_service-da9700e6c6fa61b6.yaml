features:
  - A new service was added to Vitrage, the machine learning service.
    Together with it, the first machine learning plugin was added - the
    Jaccard Correlation plugin. This plugin listens to rabbit MQ
    receiving messages about creation and deletion of alarms, and
    learns the correlation between each pair of alarms, in order to
    recommend on creation of new templates in the future.
