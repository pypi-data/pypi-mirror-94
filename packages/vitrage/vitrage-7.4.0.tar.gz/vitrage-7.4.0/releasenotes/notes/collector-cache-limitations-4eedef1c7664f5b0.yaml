issues:
  - As part of Rocky fast-failover support, vitrage-graph is now reloaded from
    the database. This causes an issue with datasources using caches that can
    become outdated after vitrage-graph restart, or if more than one
    vitrage-collector is used.
    Please avoid running multiple vitrage-collector services.
