features:
  - The ``Aodh Datasource`` is used to collect alarms from Aodh and pass them
    to Vitrage, so Vitrage can correlate them with other alarms in the system.
    In Ocata we added support for receiving immediate notifications on alarm
    state changes from Aodh. This allows Vitrage to act immediately in case
    Aodh detects a problem and there is a need to trigger new alarms (e.g. on
    an application) or modify the states of resources.
