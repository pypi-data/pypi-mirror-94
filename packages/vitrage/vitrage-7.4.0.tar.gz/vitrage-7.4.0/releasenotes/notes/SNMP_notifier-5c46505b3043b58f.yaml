features:
  - A new ``SNMP notifier`` was added, in order to send SNMP traps from Vitrage.
    SNMP traps will be sent to signed up targets, when Vitrage deduced alarm
    is raised. This notifier allows to listen to alarms raised by Vitrage.
    The new notifier is pluggable so anyone can add an implementation.
