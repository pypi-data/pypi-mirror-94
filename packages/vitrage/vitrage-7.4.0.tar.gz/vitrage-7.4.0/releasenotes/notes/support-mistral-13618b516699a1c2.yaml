features:
  - Integration with Mistral (the OpenStack workflow service).
    The Vitrage user can specify in a Vitrage template that if a certain
    condition is met (like an alarm on the host, or a combination of a few
    alarms) a Mistral workflow should be executed. The workflow can be used,
    for example, to take corrective actions.
