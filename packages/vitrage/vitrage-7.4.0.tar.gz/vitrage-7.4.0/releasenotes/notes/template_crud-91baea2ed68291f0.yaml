features:
  - Added support for template add and template delete.
    Templates can now be added/removed by the API while vitrage is running
    (no restart is required). Templates are stored in the database and remain
    after restarting vitrage.
    Adding/removing a template at runtime preforms a live
    update to the entity graph.
