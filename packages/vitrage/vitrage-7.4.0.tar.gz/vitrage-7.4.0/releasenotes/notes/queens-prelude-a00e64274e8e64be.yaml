    Vitrage Queens release contains many new features and bug fixes.

    - Major changes were made in Vitrage templates. Version 2 was introduced,
      and it includes features like:

      - templates that contain only topology definitions

      - regular expressions

      - functions (get_attr)

      The templates are now stored in a database, and there is a new API for
      adding and deleting them.

    - A support was added for webhook registration on Vitrage alarms.
      The registered webhooks will be notified on every alarm state change.

    - There are significant performance enhancements, mostly around parallel
      evaluation of the Vitrage templates.
