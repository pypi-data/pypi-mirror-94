  - A new ``Cetus Datasource`` has been introduced to include Cetus entities
    (cluster and pod) in Vitrage Entity Graph. Cetus is a self-developed
    openstack solution of k8s on openstack. It can automatically create
    multiple instances, and automatically deploy multiple k8s clusters on
    instances. Cetus mainly represents the self-developed openstack project
    and the multi-cluster k8s project, so it can be operated through openstack
    authentication access. Cetus mainly includes cetus.cluster, cetus.pod,
    cetus.node corresponding to k8s cluster, pod, node, among cetus.node is
    vm instance or bm instance in openstack, so only includes cetus.cluster
    and cetus.pod in the cetus datasource. At this point, Cetus entities are
    extracted using PULL approach, based on periodical snapshot-query to Cetus
    API for the current list of Cetus entities.
