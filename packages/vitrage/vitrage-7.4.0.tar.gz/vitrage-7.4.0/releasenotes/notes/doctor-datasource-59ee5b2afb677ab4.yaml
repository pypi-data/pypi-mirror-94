  - A new ``Doctor Datasource`` was added in order to support the OPNFV Doctor
    Inspector requirements. This datasource handles notifications sent from
    the Doctor monitor. If a ``compute.host.down`` notification arrives,
    the Doctor datasource will create an alarm on the host in Vitrage,
    call nova force-down API and create deduced alarms on the relevant
    instances and applications.
