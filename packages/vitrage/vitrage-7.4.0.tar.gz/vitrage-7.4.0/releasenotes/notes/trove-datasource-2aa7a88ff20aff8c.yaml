  - A new ``Trove Datasource`` has been introduced to include Trove entities
    (database instances and clusters) in Vitrage Entity Graph. Trove is Database
    as a Service solution offering database lifecycle management (automated
    provisioning, configuration, backups, clustering etc.). Adding the
    datasource to Vitrage enables detecting problems at lower levels of
    infrastructure that may affect functioning of running databases, and react
    in response to identified issues e.g. scale the database up/out or
    live-migrate virtual machines from failed compute. This change is the
    first stage of integration with Trove. At this point, Trove entities are
    extracted using PULL approach, based on periodical snapshot-query to Trove
    API for the current list of Trove entities. In the future, PUSH approach
    based on Trove notifications will be implemented.
