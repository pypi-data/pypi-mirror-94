    Vitrage Rocky release contains significant infrastructure changes that
    bring a lot of value to the end user. The main ones are:

    - Graph fast-failover and better HA support.
    - High-scale support. The graph was tested to work with over 100,000 entities.
    - Alarm and RCA history.

    In addition, we added Kubernetes and Prometheus datasources.
