features:
  - The Vitrage ``Static Datasource`` is meant to define in a yaml file cloud
    resources that cannot be retrieved dynamically. Switches are a good
    example, as currently no OpenStack project provides information about them.
    In Newton, only switches could be defined in the static yaml files.
    In Ocata the file definition was enhanced, so the user can define
    practically everything. The new schema is subset of the Vitrage evaluator
    templates schema, to make it easier to use and maintain.
deprecations:
  - The ``static_physical`` file format is deprecated. Please use the new
    ``static`` file format instead.
