  - A new ``Monasca Datasource`` has been introduced to include Monasca alarms
    in Vitrage Entity Graph. Monasca is Monitoring as a Service solution
    offering centralized monitoring sink for metrics gathered by Monasca Agents
    at many infrastructure levels. Moreover it provides alarm management API
    that enables defining alarms based on collected metrics.

    This change is the first stage of integration with Monasca. At this point,
    Monasca entities are extracted using PULL approach, based on periodical
    snapshot-query to Monasca Alarm API for the current list of alarm entities.
    In the future, PUSH approach based on Monasca notifications will be
    implemented.

    Current implementation requires that the metrics associated with the given
    alarm contain information about resource type and ID - required for
    associating alarms with entities in Vitrage Entity Graph. This additional
    information should be included in the form of metric dimensions, precisely
    ``resource_type`` and ``resource_id``. Dimensions can be defined in Monasca
    agent configuration.
