features:
  - The collector service was changed to run on demand instead of periodically,
    hence it can now be run in active-active mode. This is as part of a larger
    design to improve high availability.
  - Oslo service was replaced by cotyledon, so Vitrage uses real threads and
    multiprocessing. This change removes unnecessary complications of using
    eventlets and timers.
  - Created a dedicated process for the api handler, for better handling api
    calls under stress.
