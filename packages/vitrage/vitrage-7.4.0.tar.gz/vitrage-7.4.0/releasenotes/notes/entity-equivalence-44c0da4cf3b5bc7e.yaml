features:
  - Support definition of entity equivalence. If the equivalence between A and
    B is configured, all scenarios linked to entity A will be expanded to
    equivalent scenarios, i.e. same conditions and actions with the referenced
    entity A replaced by entity B. One use case of equivalence is treating
    equivalent alarms from multiple data source as the same, but no need for
    duplicating scenario definition in templates.
