The migrations in `alembic_migrations/versions` contain the changes needed to
migrate between Vitrage database revisions. A migration occurs by executing a
script that details the changes needed to upgrade the database. The migration
scripts are ordered so that multiple scripts can run sequentially. The scripts
are executed by Vitrage's migration wrapper which uses the Alembic library to
manage the migration. Vitrage supports migration from Train release or later.

Please see https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html for general documentation

To create alembic migrations use:
$ vitrage-dbsync-revision --message --autogenerate

Stamp db with most recent migration version, without actually running migrations
$ vitrage-dbsync-stamp --revision head

Upgrade can be performed by:
$ vitrage-dbsync - for backward compatibility
$ vitrage-dbsync --revision head
