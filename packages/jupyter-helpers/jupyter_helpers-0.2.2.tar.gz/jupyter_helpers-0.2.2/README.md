# Jupyter helpers for IPython

This collection of IPython helpers optimized for JupyterLab users will help you to:

- Play a sound once the computations have finished (or failed)
- Integrate the notifications with your OS (ready for GNOME shell)
- Enable auto-completion for rpy2 (great for using  ggplot2!) - now also available in [jupyterlab-lsp](https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lsp)
- Summarize dictionaries and other structures in a nice table
- Selectively import from other notebooks
- Scroll to the recently executed cell on error or when opening the notebook
- Use interactive (following) tail for long outputs


The examples are available in [demos](https://github.com/krassowski/jupyter-helpers/tree/master/demos) directory. Please, see the [Productivity tips for Jupyter (Python)](https://medium.com/@krassowski.michal/productivity-tips-for-jupyter-python-a3614d70c770) article for introduction and more code samples. For jump-to-definition feature, please visit [jupyterlab-lsp](https://github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lsp).



### Installation

For basic functionality:

```bash
pip3 install jupyter_helpers
```

To include interactive widgets:

```bash
pip3 install ipywidgets
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```

To use advanced GNOME integration,
run `setup.sh` script from the installation directory (PRs welcome to propose a better setup procedure).

To check if you have required system libraries for the better GNOME integration, see [notify-send.sh repository](https://github.com/vlevit/notify-send.sh).
