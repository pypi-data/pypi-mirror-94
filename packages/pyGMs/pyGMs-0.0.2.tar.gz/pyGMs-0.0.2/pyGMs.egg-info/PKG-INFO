Description: pyGM : A Python toolbox for Graphical Models
        ================
        
        This code provides a simple Python-based interface for defining probabilistic
        graphical models (Bayesian networks, factor graphs, etc.) over discrete random
        variables, along with a number of routines for approximate inference.  It is
        being developed for use in teaching, as well as prototyping for research.
        
        The code currently uses [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) for representing and
        operating on the table-based representation of discrete factors, and
        [SortedContainers](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sortedcontainers) for some
        internal representations.  Smaller portions use [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
        and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) as well.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Simply download or clone the repository to a directory *pyGM*, and add its
        parent directory to your Python path, either:
        ```
        $ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/directory/containing/
        ```
        or in Python
        ```
        import sys
        sys.path.append('/directory/containing/')
        ```
