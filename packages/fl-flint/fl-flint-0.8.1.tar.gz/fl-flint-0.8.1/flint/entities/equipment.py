This file defines entities for equipment. 'Equipment' includes anything
which can be mounted on a ship or carried in its hold.

There are also several non-entity section types that appear in equipment
files. These include Lod, TradeLane, InternalFX, AttachedFX, Explosion,
Light, Motor, LootCrate, and Shield. Currently these are excluded as
they do not exactly fit flint's entity model, and partly for the sake
of simplicity in the first incarnation of equipment parsing.

Because of the sheer number of classes in this file, apart from abstract
classes they currently have a 1-1 mapping with INI section types to
simplify and optimise instantiation logic. So, for example, subtypes of
Gun could be Missile and Turret, but instead you should determine if a
Gun instance is one of these by checking its attributes.
