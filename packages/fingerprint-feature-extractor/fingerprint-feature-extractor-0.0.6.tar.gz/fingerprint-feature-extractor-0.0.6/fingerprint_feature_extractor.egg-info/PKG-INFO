Description: # Fingerprint-Feature-Extraction-Python
            extracts the minutiae features from fingerprint images.
        	Features that are extracted:
        	a) Terminations: These are the minutiae end points --> associated feature includes location of the minutiae point(LocX, LocY), and "theta", the angle of the ridge
        	b) Bifurcations: These are points where one ridge gets splits into two --> associated feature includes location of the minutiae point(LocX, LocY), and "theta1", "theta2", "theta3", the three angles of the ridges
        	
        
        ## Quickstart
            This library extracts fingerprint minutiae features which is necessary in biometric recognition systems applications.
        
        ## Installation
        
            To install, run:
            ```
            pip install fingerprint-feature-extractor
            ```
        
        ## Usage:
        	```Python
        	import fingerprint_feature_extractor
        	
        	img = cv2.imread('image_path', 0)				# read the input image --> You can enhance the fingerprint image using the "fingerprint_enhancer" library
        	FeaturesTerminations, FeaturesBifurcations = fingerprint_feature_extractor.extract_minutiae_features(img, showResult=True, spuriousMinutiaeThresh=10)
        	```
        	As easy as that!
