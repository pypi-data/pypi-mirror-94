## Preview

## Install

The plugin is available as a Python package and can be installed with pip.

Run `pip install netbox-topology-views` in your virtual env.

To ensure NetBox Topology Views plugin is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the NetBox root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `netbox-topology-views` package:

```no-highlight
# echo netbox-topology-views >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `configuration.py`

```python
# In your configuration.py
PLUGINS = ["netbox_topology_views"]
```

Then run `python3 manage.py collectstatic --no-input`

### Custom field: coordinates

There is also support for custom fiels.

If you create a custom field "coordinates" for "dcim > device" with type "text" and name "coordinates" you will see the same layout every time.

The coordinates can then be provided as: "X;Y"

## Configure

If you want to override the default values configure the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` in your `netbox configuration.py`.

Example:
```
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    'netbox_topology_views': {
        'device_img': 'router,switch,firewall',
        'preselected_device_roles': 'Router, Firewall'
    }
}
```

| Setting        | Default value           | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| device_img      | 'access-switch,core-switch,firewall,router,distribution-switch,backup,storage,wan-network,wireless-ap,server,internal-switch,isp-cpe-material,non-racked-devices,power-units' | The slug of the device roles that you have a image for. |
| preselected_device_roles      | 'Firewall,Router,Distribution Switch,Core Switch,Internal Switch,Access Switch,Server,Storage,Backup,Wireless AP' | The full name of the device roles you want to pre select in the global view.  Note that this is case sensitive|
| allow_coordinates_saving      | False | (bool) Set to true if you use the custom coordinates fields and want to save the coordinates |
| ignore_cable_type      | 'power outlet,power port' | The cable types that you want to ignore in the views  |
| preselected_tags      | '' | The name of tags you want to preload  |
| enable_circuit_terminations      | False  | (bool) Set to true if you want to see circuit terminations in the topology  |

### Custom Images

You upload you own custom images to the netbox static dir (`static/netbox_topology_views/img/`).
These images need to be named after de device role slug and have the .png format/extension.
If you add your own image you also need to add the slug to the `device_img` setting.
