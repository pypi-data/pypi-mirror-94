Description: 
        eleanor is a python package to extract target pixel files from
        TESS Full Frame Images and produce systematics-corrected light curves
        for any star observed by the TESS mission. In its simplest form, eleanor
        takes a TIC ID, a Gaia source ID, or (RA, Dec) coordinates of a star
        observed by TESS and returns, as a single object, a light curve and
        accompanying target pixel data.

        Changes to v2.0.1 (2020-12-08):
        * Minor bug fixes
        
        Changes to v2.0.0rc1 (2020-10-05):
        * Changing skip parameter in correction to be in unit of time rather than cadences to handle 10-minute FFIs
        * Fixed bug where very faint stars had suboptimal corrections
        * Changed `crowded_field` to `aperture_mode` and added built-in mechanics for bright stars
        * Updated docs to include citation to 2019 paper 
        * Fixed bug in eleanor.Visualize() layout of aperture
        * Changes to handle format of 10-minute FFIs in eleanor.Update()
        * Significant speedups, especially when local postcards already exist and run with local==True
        * Other bug fixes
        
        Changes to v1.0.5 (2020-05-21):
        * Fixed bug where some apertures were made twice and others not at all
        * Fixed bug where mass centroids were off by a constant offset at all cadences
        * Fixed bug that happens when data are all zeros at the start of a sector
        
        Changes to v1.0.4 (2020-03-27):
        * Pass in an array of regressors to use in calculating the corrected flux
        * Extreme short-term flux variability like eclipses ignored in corrections, which should improve detrending of these objects
        * Fixed bug where metadata could not be properly updated on linux clusters
        * Improvements to Gaia overlay of fields
        * Ability to create light curves offline
        * Ability to pass through a SIMBAD-resolvable name rather than TIC/Gaia ID or coordinates
        * Other minor bug fixes
        
        Changes to v1.0.1 (2019-12-19):
        * Ability to use local postcards
        * Addition of eleanor.Update() for automatic sector updates
        * Significant speedups when TIC, Coords, and a Gaia ID are all provided
        * Other bug fixes
        
        Changes to v1.0.0 (2020-01-14):
        * Pass in the name of the source as a string
        * Other bugfixes
