"""
A Pyramid tween that begins and ends transactions around its handler
using the :class:`nti.transactions.loop.TransactionLoop`.

This very similar to earlier versions of :mod:`pyramid_tm`, but with
the following substantial differences:

    - The transaction is rolled back if the request is deemed to be
      side-effect free (this has intimate knowledge of the paths that
      do not follow the HTTP rules for a GET being side-effect free;
      however, if you are a GET request and you violate the rules by
      having side-effects, you can set the environment key
      ``nti.request_had_transaction_side_effects`` to ``True``)

    - Logging is added to account for the time spent in aborts and
      commits.

    - Later versions of :mod:`pyramid_tm` were split into two parts,
      with :mod:`pyramid_retry` being used to handle retry using an
      "execution policy", which was new in Pyramid 1.9. This library
      is compatible with all versions of Pyramid from 1.2 onward.

Install this tween using the ``add_tween`` method::

    pyramid_config.add_tween(
        'nti.transactions.pyramid_tween.transaction_tween_factory',
        under=pyramid.tweens.EXCVIEW)

You may install it under or over the exception view, depending on whether you
need the transaction to be active in exception views.

If you have a tween that manages a ZODB connection, it should be installed
*above* this tween. That's because ZODB connections cannot be closed while
joined to a transaction; the transaction must be committed or aborted first.
