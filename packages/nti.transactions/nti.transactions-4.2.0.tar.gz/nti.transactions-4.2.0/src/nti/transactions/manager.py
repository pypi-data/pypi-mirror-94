    """
    A generic (and therefore relatively expensive)
    :class:`transaction.interfaces.IDataManager` that invokes a
    callable (usually a method of an object) when the transaction
    finishes successfully. The method should not raise exceptions when
    invoked, as they will be caught and ignored (to preserve
    consistency with the rest of the data managers). If there's a
    chance the method could fail, then whatever actions it does take
    should not have side-effects.

    These data managers have no guaranteed relationship to other data
    managers in terms of the order of which they commit, except as
    documented with :meth:`sortKey`.

    Because these data managers execute exactly one operation on a
    complete transaction commit, implementing a savepoint is trivial:
    do nothing when it is rolled back. A savepoint is created to checkpoint
    a transaction and rolled back to reverse actions taken *after* the
    checkpoint. Only data managers that were active (joined) at the
    time the transaction savepoint is created are asked to create
    their own savepoint, and then potentially to roll it back. We do
    no work until the transaction is committed, so we have nothing
    to rollback. Moroever, if a transaction savepoint is activated
    before a manager joins, then that manager is not asked for its own
    savepoint: it is simply aborted and unjoined from the transaction if
    the previous savepoint is rolledback.

        Return the string value that, when sorted, determines the
        order in which data managers will get to vote and commit at
        the end of a transaction. (See
        :meth:`transaction.interfaces.IDataManager.sortKey`).

        The default implementation of this method uses the ID of
        either the ``target`` object we were initialized with or the ID of
        the actual callable we will call. This has the property of
        ensuring that *all* calls to methods of a particular object
        instance (when ``target`` is given), or calls to a particular callable
        (when ``target`` is not given) will execute in the order in which they were
        added to the transaction.

        .. note:: This relies on an implementation detail of the
            transaction package, which sorts using :meth:`list.sort`,
            which is guaranteed to be stable: thus objects using the
            same key remain in the same relative order. (See
            :meth:`transaction._transaction.Transaction._commitResources`.)

        To execute only calls to a particular method of a particular instance
        in the order they are added to the transaction, but allow other
        methods to execute before or after them, do not provide the ``target``.

        It is not advisable to use the ID of this object (``self``) in
        the implementation of this method, because the ID values are
        not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing and thus
        instances of a particular class that did this would execute in
        "random" order.
