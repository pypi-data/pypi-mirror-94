    Similar to the transaction attempts mechanism, but less error
    prone and with added logging and hooks.

    This object is callable (passing any arguments along to its
    handler) and runs its handler in the transaction loop.

    The handler code may doom the transaction, but they must not
    attempt to commit or abort it. A doomed transaction, or one whose
    commit is vetoed by :meth:`should_abort_due_to_no_side_effects` or
    :meth:`should_veto_commit` is never retried.

    Aborting or committing the transaction will set these :mod:`perfmetrics`
    timers:

    transaction.commit
        Time taken to commit the transaction. Sampled.
    transaction.abort
        Time taken to abort the transaction. Sampled.

    Running the loop will increment these :mod:`perfmetrics` counters
    (new in 3.1):

    transaction.retry
        The number of retries required in any given loop. Note that
        if the handler raises non-retryable exceptions, this number will
        be inflated.
    transaction.side_effect_free
        How many side-effect free transactions there have been.
    transaction.side_effect_free_violation
        How many side-effect free transactions actually had resource
        managers joined to the transaction, and so potentially aborted
        work that wanted to be committed. (3.1.1)
    transaction.vetoed
        How many transactions were vetoed.
    transaction.doomed
        The number of doomed transactions.
    transaction.successful
        The number of transactions that successfully returned.
    transaction.failed
        The number of transactions that did not successfully return.

       Instances of this class must be thread safe, and running the loop should
       not mutate the state of this object.

       When this object is called, the thread-local default or global
       :class:`transaction.TransactionManager` is placed into explicit
       mode (if it wasn't already). The handler callable is forbidden
       from beginning, aborting or committing the transaction. Explicit
       transactions can be faster in ZODB, and are easier to reason
       about.

       If the application begins, commits or aborts the transaction, it
       can expect this object to raise
