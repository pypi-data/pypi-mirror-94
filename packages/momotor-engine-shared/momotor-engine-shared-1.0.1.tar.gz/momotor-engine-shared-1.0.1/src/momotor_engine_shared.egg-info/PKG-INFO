Description: This package is a part of [Momotor](https://momotor.org/), a tool for automated processing of digital content. 
        
        Momotor accepts digital content as a product bundle and generates a result bundle from this product under 
        control of a recipe bundle. 
        
        Momotor is like a continuous integration system, but broader in scope. The 
        type of content that Momotor can process is not restricted; each recipe may impose its own constraints. 
        One application of Momotor in an educational setting is the automatic generation of feedback on work submitted 
        for programming assignments.
