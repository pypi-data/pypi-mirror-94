    This documentation is a work in process, and is far from complete.

Formulaic is a high-performance implementation of Wilkinson formulas for Python,
which are very useful for transforming dataframes into a form suitable for
ingestion into various modelling frameworks (especially linear regression).

- **Source Code**: https://github.com/matthewwardrop/formulaic
- **Issue tracker**: https://github.com/matthewwardrop/formulaic/issues

!!! warning
    While this project is now fully functional, the API is still subject to
    change between major versions (`0.<major>.<minor>`) as we continue to
    improve things. If you are going to depend on it in another project, it is
    advisable to pin formulaic to within a major version, for example:
    `formulaic>=0.1.0,<0.2`.

It provides:

- high-performance dataframe to model-matrix conversions.
- support for reusing the encoding choices made during conversion of one data-set on other datasets.
- extensible formula parsing.
- extensible data input/output plugins, with implementations for:
  - input:
    - `pandas.DataFrame`
    - `pyarrow.Table`
  - output:
    - `pandas.DataFrame`
    - `numpy.ndarray`
    - `scipy.sparse.CSCMatrix`
- support for symbolic differentiation of formulas (and hence model matrices).

with more to come!

For some examples of what Formulaic provides, and how to use it, please refer to
the [Basic Usage](basic/intro.md) and [Advanced Usage](advanced/intro.md)
guides.
