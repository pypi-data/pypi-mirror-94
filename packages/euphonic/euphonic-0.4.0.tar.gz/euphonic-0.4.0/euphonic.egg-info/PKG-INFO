        ========
        
        Euphonic is a Python package that can efficiently calculate phonon
        bandstructures and inelastic neutron scattering intensities from a
        force constants matrix (e.g. from a .castep_bin file). While Euphonic
        is primarily a library, a command-line tool is provided for convenient
        plotting of inelastic neutron scattering intensities from
        force-constants data.
        
        Euphonic can also plot previously-calculated dispersion and density of
        states data from a CASTEP .phonon file.
