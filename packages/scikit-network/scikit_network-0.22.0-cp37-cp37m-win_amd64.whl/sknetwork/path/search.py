        The node from which to start the ordering

    -------
    node_array : np.ndarray
        The breadth-first list of nodes, starting with specified node. The length of node_array is the number of nodes
        reachable from the specified node.
    predecessors : np.ndarray
        Returned only if ``return_predecessors == True``. The list of predecessors of each node in a breadth-first tree.
        If node ``i`` is in the tree, then its parent is given by ``predecessors[i]``. If node ``i`` is not in the tree
        (and for the parent node) then ``predecessors[i] = -9999``.
