    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors :
        Number of neighbors for each sample in the transformed sparse graph.
    undirected :
        As the nearest neighbor relationship is not symmetric, the graph is directed by default.
        Setting this parameter to ``True`` forces the algorithm to return undirected graphs.
    leaf_size :
        Leaf size passed to KDTree.
        This can affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the tree.
    p :
        Which Minkowski p-norm to use. 1 is the sum-of-absolute-values “Manhattan” distance,
        2 is the usual Euclidean distance infinity is the maximum-coordinate-difference distance.
        A finite large p may cause a ValueError if overflow can occur.
    eps :
        Return approximate nearest neighbors; the k-th returned value is guaranteed to be no further than (1+tol_nn)
        times the distance to the real k-th nearest neighbor.
    n_jobs :
        Number of jobs to schedule for parallel processing. If -1 is given all processors are used.

    Attributes
    ----------
    adjacency_ :
        Adjacency matrix of the graph.
