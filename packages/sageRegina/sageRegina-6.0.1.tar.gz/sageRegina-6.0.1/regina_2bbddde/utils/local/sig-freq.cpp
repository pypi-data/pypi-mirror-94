/**
 * Like normal-mpi, but inputs isomorphism signatures and outputs frequency
 * tables.
 *
 * This tool enumerates normal surfaces in both standard and quad coordinates,
 * and writes a corresponding frequency table to files called sfreq and qfreq.
 *
 * Each frequency table will contain several lines of the form:
 *
 * <size> <count>
 *
 * where precisely <count> triangulations in the corresponding data
 * file have precisely <size> vertex normal surfaces.  Lines will be
 * sorted in ascending order by <size>, and only lines with non-zero
 * <count> will be written.
 *
 * TODO:  Only triangulations with < MAX_FREQ vertex surfaces are
 * supported.  Before this code is used in any real computations, add
 * error checking to handle the case where >= MAX_FREQ vertex surfaces
 * are found.
