<h1>Regina on the iPad</h1>
<p><b>Welcome to the iPad version of Regina!</b></p>
<p>
The best way to get to know Regina
is simply to play around with it.
Regina ships with several example files,
which you can access through the <b>Documents</b> menu to your left.
<p>
For an excellent starting point, try
<b>Introductory examples</b>.
<p>
To import your existing Regina or SnapPea/SnapPy documents, you can
open them as email attachments, import them from Dropbox, or upload them
through iTunes.  To export a document from this app,
press the share button in the top-right corner of the screen.
<p>
To create a new document, press the <b>+</b> button in the top-left
corner of the screen.
<p>
The iPad version of Regina is very new, and offers
most but not all of what Regina can do on the desktop.
