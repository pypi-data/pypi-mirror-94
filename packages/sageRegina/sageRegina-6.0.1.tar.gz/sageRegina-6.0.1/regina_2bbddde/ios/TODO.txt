iOS User Interface TODO List
----------------------------

LONG-TERM:

- Support iCloud and/or iCloud drive?
- Support files without container roots
- Move packets around the tree.
- Find a way to install *.tdb in a subdirectory beneath Resources/.
- Rename actions: ensure table view insets are OK if the device is rotated while the keyboard is shown
- Audit the use of UIAlert (should we use banners instead)?
- See if we can't arrange syntax highlighting for the script viewer.
- PDF viewer: use a filename based on the packet label.
- Surface coordinates viewer: support filters
- Implement connectedSumWith.
- Decide what to do about "ambiguous row height" warning in iOS 8 (FilterViewController, ScriptViewController)
- Test suite failure: mail the developers automatically?
- NewSurfacesController::updateProgress: replace switch statements with something more robust against GUI changes?
- SurfacesCoords: on long press, view details (in case cells are too narrow).
- Work out why horizontal alert views end up cropped (check autolayout
  messages dumped to the log).
- Centre face(t) pairing graphs in the UIWebView.

- Support state preservation and restoration.  See:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/StatePreservation/StatePreservation.html

- iCloud:
  + Support, including moving files to/from iCloud storage.
  + Indicate error conditions and handle document-version conflicts.
  + All documents in iCloud or none.  See: https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/DocumentBasedAppPGiOS/ManageDocumentLifeCycle/ManageDocumentLifeCycle.html
