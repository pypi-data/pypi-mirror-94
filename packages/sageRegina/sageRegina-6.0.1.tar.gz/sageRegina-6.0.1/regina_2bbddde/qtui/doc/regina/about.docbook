  &regina; is a software package for low-dimensional topologists.
  Historically, its main strengths lie in 3-manifold topology: it has a
  highly optimised toolkit with a focus on normal surface theory,
  angle structures, and the combinatorial structures of triangulations,
  and it now performs many high-level topological algorithms for 3-manifolds.
  &regina; also offers rich toolkits for knots and links and
  triangulated 4-manifolds, and offers more basic combinatorial support
  for manifolds of dimension 5&ndash;15.
  For more on these and its many other features, see the
  <link linkend="featureset">full feature set</link>
  later in this introduction.

   The best way to become familiar with &regina; is simply to play
   around with it.  &regina; ships with several example files, including
   a number of censuses of 3-manifold triangulations.  Most of these examples
   can be accessed through the
   <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>File</guimenu>
    <guimenuitem>Open Example</guimenuitem>
   </menuchoice>
   menu when running &regina;.
  </para>

   For an excellent starting point, try

    <guisubmenu>Open Example</guisubmenu>
    <guimenuitem>Introductory Examples</guimenuitem>
   </menuchoice>,
   which illustrates most of the structures that &regina; can work with.
   The users' handbook (which you are reading now) also includes a number of
   <link linkend="sessions">sample &python; sessions</link>
   that illustrate how &regina;'s in-built &python; scripting can be used.

   In 1997 in Melbourne, David Letscher, Richard Rannard and Ben Burton
   under the guidance of J.&nbsp;Hyam Rubinstein planned out a program that
   would do normal surface theory and everything else besides.  Much
   groundwork planning was done, epsilon code was written and then
   things kind of faded away.  David Letscher revived the project on his
   own and in 1999 presented <application>Normal 1.0</application>.
   This program performed
   triangulation simplification and found vertex normal surfaces, was
   written in &java; and was a proof-of-concept program that normal
   surface theory was computationally feasible.
  </para>
  <para>
   In March 1999, David and Ben sat down to write a new version
   of the program from scratch.  The new version would have a
   calculation engine written in &cpp; for speed and would have a &java;
   GUI for portability.  It would be carefully
   designed and written with rigour and extensibility in mind, allowing
   for the possibility of add-ons written by other people.
  </para>
  <para>
   David however leads a busy life and pulled out of the project in
   late 2000, but remained to offer technical advice.  In late 2000 a
   prerelease of the new program was ready and &regina; 2.0 was
   uploaded to the web.
  </para>
  <para>
   Since then, <link linkend="acknowledgements">many more people</link>
   have been involved in both small ways and large.
   &regina; has also undergone some major structural changes over the years:
   In late 2003 the old &java; user interface was completely removed in
   favour of a faster and cleaner native &cpp; user interface (written
   using the excellent &kde; libraries), and the scripting interface
   switched from &jython; to standard &python; support.
   By 2012 the user interface had been ported from &kde; to the more
   portable &qt;, offering a much cleaner experience on &macosx; and
   supporting &windows; for the first time.
   In 2016 the underlying &cpp; code was redeveloped in a much more generic
   style, merging the existing 3-manifolds code with a long-running
   project with Ryan Budney on 4-manifolds, and creating a new
   infrastructure for exploring triangulations in dimensions as high as 15.

  <title>Who is Regina?</title>

  <para>
   This normal surface theory software has been named after Regina
   Basman who once told me she was the most normal person
   I knew.  She's studied mathematics, reads interesting books, has a gorgeous
   child and likes running around rainforests in the dark.
