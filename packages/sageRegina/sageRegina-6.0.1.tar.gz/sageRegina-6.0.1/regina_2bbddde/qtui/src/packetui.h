         * For many interface elements, edits are automatically committed
         * before anything else is done with the packet (in particular,
         * before an action is triggered on the packet).  However, there
         * are exceptions.  For instance:
         *
         * - If a QTableView or QListView cell is being edited and an
         *   action is triggered, the table or list may not update
         *   its model (i.e., commit the edit) until \e after the action
         *   event has been processed.  This means that the action event
         *   needs to force the commit itself, to avoid operating on the
         *   old version of the packet.
         *
         * - If a DocWidget text document is being edited, edits are
         *   automatically comitted only when the widget loses focus.
         *   As before, if an action is triggered then the focus-out
         *   event (and hence the commit) might not be processed until
         *   after the action.
         *
         * Any packet interface that suffers from such problems must do
         * two things:
         *
         * - override endEdit() to commit any edits-in-progress to the
         *   calculation engine (the table class EditTableView, the list
         *   class EditListView and the text document class DocWidget
         *   provide convenient means for doing this);
         *
         * - call endEdit() as the first step for each action event on
         *   the packet (e.g., each action slot).
         *
         * It is possible that an edit-in-progress cannot be committed
         * (for instance, the table cell being edited contains invalid data).
         * In this case an appropriate error message may be displayed
         * to the user, and the edit should be rolled back.
         *
         * The default implementation of this routine does nothing
         * (i.e., it assumes there are no edits-in-progress to commit,
         * or else the commits are (i) automatic and (ii) happen before
         * any actions are triggered).
