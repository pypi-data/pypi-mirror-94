Main source repository for Regina
---------------------------------

This repository contains the sources for building Regina.

Users should only need to check out this repository if they wish to explore
bleeding-edge features that are still under development.

If you simply want the latest release, you can download ready-made packages
and/or a source tarball from http://regina-normal.github.io/#download .

To run regina from the command-line:

  * Type `regina-gui` for the graphical user interface;
  * Type `regina-python` for the python-only scripting interface.

If you encounter problems:

  * See http://regina-normal.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html for help
    with the graphical user interface and python scripting;

  * See http://regina-normal.github.io/source.html and
    http://regina-normal.github.io/buildtips.html for help with building
    Regina from sources.

Enjoy!
