Regina Python Interface Directory
---------------------------------

This directory tree contains the sources for the calculation engine
Python bindings, which are built into the Python module "regina".

Like the calculation engine itself, these sources are written in C++.
They use the pybind11 header-only library, which is shipped with Regina
in the subdirectory regina/pybind11/ .
