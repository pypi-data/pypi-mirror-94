/*! \file packet/packetregistry.h
 *  \brief Provides access to a registry of all packet types known to Regina.
 *
 *  Each time a new packet type is created, the file packetregistry-impl.h
 *  must be updated to include it.  Instructions on how to do this are
 *  included in packetregistry-impl.h.
 *
 *  External routines can access the registry by calling one of the
 *  forPacket() template functions defined in packetregistry.h.
 *
 *  \warning You should not include this header unless it is necessary,
 *  since it will automatically import every header for every packet type
 *  in the registry.

/**
 * Allows the user to call a template function whose template parameter
 * matches a given value of PacketType, which is not known
 * until runtime.  In essence, this routine contains a switch/case statement
 * that runs through all possible packet types known to Regina.
 *
 * The advantages of this routine are that (i) the user does not need to
 * repeatedly type such switch/case statements themselves; and (ii) if
 * a new packet type is added then only a small amount of code
 * needs to be extended to incorporate it.
 *
 * In detail: the function object \a func must define a templated bracket
 * operator, so that <tt>func.operator()<PacketInfo<t>>(...)</tt> is defined
 * for any valid PacketType enum value \a t.  Then, when the user calls
 * <tt>forPacket(packetType, func, defaultReturn, ...)</tt>, this routine
 * will call <tt>func.operator()<PacketInfo<packetType>>(...)</tt> and pass
 * back the corresponding return value.  If \a packetType does not denote a
 * valid packet type, then forPacket() will pass back \a defaultReturn instead.
 *
 * There is also a variant of forPacket() that works with void functions,
 * and so does not take the extra \a defaultReturn argument.
 *
 * \pre The function object must have a typedef \a ReturnType indicating
 * the return type of the corresponding templated bracket operator.
 * Inheriting from Returns<...> is a convenient way to ensure this.

 * call with a PacketInfo<packetType> object.

 * is not valid.
 * @param args any additional arguments to pass to the bracket operator
 * for \a func.  These will be copied/moved, so if you wish to pass
 * references then you may need to wrap them in std::ref or std::cref.
 * @return the return value from the corresponding bracket
 * operator of \a func, or \a defaultReturn if the given packet type
 * is not valid.
