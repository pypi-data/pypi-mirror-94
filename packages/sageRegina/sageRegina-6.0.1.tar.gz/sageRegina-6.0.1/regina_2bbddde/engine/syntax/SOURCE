This is a stripped-down and heavily modified version of the syntax-highlighting
framework from KDE Frameworks 5.28.0:

- it has been simplified (and silently drops some metadata from the syntax
  definitions as a result);
- its Qt dependencies have been replaced with libraries that are already used
  by Regina's calculation engine (e.g., the C++ standard library and libxml2);
- all hard-coded string and characters in the rules are treated as plain ASCII
  (not unicode);
- dynamic rules (which use regex captures instead of hard-coded strings) are
  not supported;
- the repository is hard-coded to only load those definitions and themes that
  Regina needs, and these are loaded directly from Regina's data directories.

The original KDE framework was downloaded on 21 Nov 2016 from:
