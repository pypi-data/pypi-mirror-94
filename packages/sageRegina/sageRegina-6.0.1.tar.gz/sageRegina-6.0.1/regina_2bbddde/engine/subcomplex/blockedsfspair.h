/**
 * Represents a blocked pair of Seifert fibred spaces joined along a single
 * connecting torus.  This is a particular type of triangulation of a graph
 * manifold, formed from two saturated regions whose torus boundaries are
 * identified.  An optional layering may be placed between the two torus
 * boundaries to allow for a more interesting relationship between the boundary
 * curves of each region.  For more detail on saturated regions and their
 * constituent saturated blocks, see the SatRegion class; for more detail
 * on layerings, see the Layering class.
 *
 * Each of the two saturated regions must have precisely one boundary
 * component formed from just one saturated annulus, and this boundary may
 * not be twisted (i.e., it must be a torus, not a Klein bottle).  The
 * way in which the boundaries from each region are identified is
 * specified by a 2-by-2 matrix \a M, which expresses curves
 * representing the fibres and base orbifold of the second region in
 * terms of the first (see the page on \ref sfsnotation for terminology).
 *
 * More specifically, suppose that \a f0 and \a o0 are directed curves on
 * the first region boundary and \a f1 and \a o1 are directed curves on the
 * second region boundary, where \a f0 and \a f1 represent the fibres of
 * each region and \a o0 and \a o1 represent the base orbifolds.  Then
 * the boundaries are joined according to the following relation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [f1]       [f0]
 *     [  ] = M * [  ]
 *     [o1]       [o0]
 * </pre>
 *
 * If a layering is present between the two boundaries, then the
 * boundary curves are not identified directly.  In this case, the matrix
 * \a M shows how the layering relates the curves on each region boundary.
 *
 * Note that the routines writeName() and writeTeXName() do \e not
 * offer enough information to uniquely identify the triangulation,
 * since this essentially requires 2-dimensional assemblings of
 * saturated blocks.  For full details, writeTextLong() may be used instead.
 *
 * The optional StandardTriangulation routine manifold() is
 * implemented for this class, but homology() is not.
