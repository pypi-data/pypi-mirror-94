/**
 * Represents a layered loop component of a triangulation.
 *
 * A layered loop is a layered chain of \a n tetrahedra whose bottom
 * tetrahedron is layered onto its top tetrahedron to form a complete
 * loop.  See the LayeredChain class notes for a description of a
 * layered chain.
 *
 * To make a layered chain into a layered
 * loop, the bottom faces of the first tetrahedron will be
 * layered upon the top faces of the last tetrahedron, completing the loop.
 * At this stage there is a choice.  The layering can be done in the usual
 * fashion, or there may be a \a twist in which the upper square (the
 * bottom faces of the first tetrahedron) is rotated 180 degrees before
 * being layered on the lower annulus (the top faces of the last
 * tetrahedron).
 *
 * If there is a twist, the two hinge edges become identified and the
 * entire component has a single vertex.  If there is no twist, the
 * two hinge edges remain distinct (and disjoint) and the entire
 * component has two vertices.
 *
 * The \a length of the layered loop is the number of tetrahedra it
 * contains.  A layered loop must contain at least one tetrahedron.
 *
 * All optional StandardTriangulation routines are implemented for this
 * class.
