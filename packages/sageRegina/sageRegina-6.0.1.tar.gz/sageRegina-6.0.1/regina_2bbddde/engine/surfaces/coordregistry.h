/*! \file surfaces/coordregistry.h
 *  \brief Provides access to a registry of all normal coordinate systems
 *  that can be used to create and store normal surfaces in 3-manifold
 *  triangulations.
 *
 *  Each time a new coordinate system is created, the file
 *  coordregistry-impl.h must be updated to include it.  Instructions on
 *  how to do this are included in coordregistry-impl.h.
 *
 *  External routines can access the registry by calling one of the
 *  forCoords() template functions defined in coordregistry.h.
 *
 *  \warning You should not include this header unless it is necessary,
 *  since it will automatically import every header for every coordinate
 *  system in the registry.

/**
 * Allows the user to call a template function whose template parameter
 * matches a given value of NormalCoords, which is not known
 * until runtime.  In essence, this routine contains a switch/case statement
 * that runs through all possible coordinate sytems.
 *
 * The advantages of this routine are that (i) the user does not need to
 * repeatedly type such switch/case statements themselves; and (ii) if
 * a new coordinate system is added then only a small amount of code
 * needs to be extended to incorporate it.
 *
 * This function can only work with coordinate systems in which
 * you can create and store normal surfaces.  All other coordinate systems are
 * considered invalid for our purposes here.
 *
 * In detail: the function object \a func must define a templated
 * bracket operator, so that <tt>func.operator()<NormalInfo<c>>(...)</tt> is
 * defined for any valid NormalCoords enum value \a c.  Then, when the user
 * calls <tt>forCoords(coords, func, defaultReturn, ...)</tt>, this routine
 * will call <tt>func.operator()<NormalInfo<coords>>(...)</tt> and pass back
 * the corresponding return value.  If \a coords does not denote a valid
 * coordinate system as described above, then forCoords() will pass back
 * \a defaultReturn instead.
 *
 * There is also a variant of forCoords() that works with void functions,
 * and so does not take the extra \a defaultReturn argument.
 *
 * \pre The function object must have a typedef \a ReturnType indicating
 * the return type of the corresponding templated bracket operator.
 * Inheriting from Returns<...> is a convenient way to ensure this.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.
 *
 * @param coords the given normal coordinate system.
 * @param func the function object whose bracket operator we will
 * call with a NormalInfo<coords> object.
 * @param defaultReturn the value to return if the given
 * coordinate system is invalid.
 * @param args any additional arguments to pass to the bracket operator
 * for \a func.  These will be copied/moved, so if you wish to pass
 * references then you may need to wrap them in std::ref or std::cref.
 * @return the return value from the corresponding bracket
 * operator of \a func, or \a defaultReturn if the given
 * coordinate system is invalid.
