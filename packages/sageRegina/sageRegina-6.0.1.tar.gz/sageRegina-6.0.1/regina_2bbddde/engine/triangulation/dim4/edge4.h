         * Returns a full 2-manifold triangulation describing

         *
         * This routine is fast (it uses a pre-computed triangulation
         * where possible).  The downside is that the triangulation is
         * read-only, and does not contain any information on how the
         * triangles in the link correspond to pentachora in the original
         * triangulation (though this is easily deduced; see below).
         * If you want a writable triangulation, or one with this extra
         * information, then call buildLinkDetail() instead.
         *
         * The triangulation of the edge link is built as follows.
         * Let \a i lie between 0 and degree()-1 inclusive, let
         * \a pent represent <tt>embedding(i).pentachoron()</tt>,
         * and let \a e represent <tt>embedding(i).edge()</tt>.
         * Then <tt>buildLink()->triangle(i)</tt> is the triangle
         * in the edge link that links edge \a e of pentachoron \a pent.
         * In other words, <tt>buildLink()->triangle(i)</tt> in the edge link
         * is parallel to triangle <tt>pent->triangle(e)</tt> in the
         * surrounding 4-manifold triangulation.
         *
         * The vertices of each triangle in the edge link are
         * numbered as follows.  Following the discussion above,
         * suppose that <tt>buildLink()->triangle(i)</tt>
         * sits within \c pent and is parallel to
         * <tt>pent->triangle(e)</tt>.
         * Then vertices 0,1,2 of the triangle in the link will be
         * parallel to vertices 0,1,2 of the corresponding Triangle<4>.
         * The permutation <tt>pent->triangleMapping(e)</tt> will map
         * vertices 0,1,2 of the triangle in the link to the
         * corresponding vertices of \c pent (those opposite \c e),
         * and will map 3 and 4 to the vertices of \c e itself.
         *
         * This Edge<4> object will retain ownership of the triangulation
         * that is returned.  If you wish to edit the triangulation, you
         * should make a new clone and edit the clone instead.
         *
         * \ifacespython Since Python does not distinguish between const and
         * non-const, this routine will make a deep copy of the edge link.
         * You are free to modify the triangulation that is returned.
         *

         * Returns a full 2-manifold triangulation describing
         * the link of this edge.
         *
         * This routine is heavyweight (it computes a new triangulation
         * each time).  The benefit is that the triangulation is writeable,
         * and optionally contain detailed information on how the triangles
         * in the link correspond to pentachora in the original triangulation.
         * If you do not need this extra information, consider using the
         * faster buildLink() instead.
         *
         * See the buildLink() documentation for an explanation of
         * exactly how the triangulation will be constructed.
         *
         * If \a labels is passed as \c true, each triangle of the new
         * edge link will be given a text description of the form
         * <tt>p&nbsp;(e)</tt>, where \c p is the index of the pentachoron
         * the triangle is from, and \c e is the edge of that pentachoron
         * that this triangle links.
         *
         * If \a inclusion is non-null (i.e., it points to some
         * Isomorphism<4> pointer \a p), then it will be modified to
         * point to a new Isomorphism<4> that describes in detail how the
         * individual triangles of the link sit within pentachora of
         * the original triangulation.  Specifically, after this routine
         * is called, <tt>p->pentImage(i)</tt> will indicate which pentachoron
         * \a pent of the 4-manifold triangulation contains the <i>i</i>th
         * triangle of the link.  Moreover, <tt>p->facetPerm(i)</tt> will
         * indicate exactly where the <i>i</i>th triangle sits within
         * \a pent: (i) it will send 3,4 to the vertices of \a pent that lie
         * on the edge that the triangle links, with 3 and 4 mapping to
         * vertices 0 and 1 respectively of the corresponding Edge<4>;
         * and (ii) it will send 0,1,2 to the vertices of \a pent that
         * are parallel to vertices 0,1,2 of this triangle.
         *
         * The triangulation that is returned, as well as the isomorphism
         * if one was requested, will be newly allocated.  The caller of
         * this routine is responsible for destroying these objects.
         *
         * Strictly speaking, this is an abuse of the Isomorphism<4> class
         * (the domain is a triangulation of the wrong dimension, and
         * the map is not 1-to-1 into the range pentachora).  We use
         * it anyway, but you should not attempt to call any high-level
         * routines (such as Isomorphism<4>::apply).
         *
         * \ifacespython The second (isomorphism) argument is not present.
         * Instead this routine returns a pair (triangulation, isomorphism).
         * As a side-effect, the isomorphism will always be constructed
         * (i.e., it is not optional).
         *
         * \ifacespython Since Python does not distinguish between const and
         * non-const, this routine will make a deep copy of the edge link.
