         * Determines the Hilbert basis that generates all integer
         * points in the intersection of the <i>n</i>-dimensional
         * non-negative orthant with some linear subspace.
         * The resulting basis elements will be of the class \a RayClass,
         * will be newly allocated, and will be written to the given output
         * iterator.  Their deallocation is the responsibility of whoever
         * called this routine.
         *
         * The non-negative orthant is an <i>n</i>-dimensional cone with
         * its vertex at the origin.  The extremal rays of this cone are
         * the \a n non-negative coordinate axes.  This cone also has \a n
         * facets, where the <i>i</i>th facet is the non-negative
         * orthant of the plane perpendicular to the <i>i</i>th coordinate
         * axis.
         *
         * This routine takes a linear subspace, defined by the
         * intersection of a set of hyperplanes through the origin (this
         * subspace is described as a matrix, with each row giving the
         * equation for one hyperplane).
         *
         * The purpose of this routine is to compute the Hilbert basis of
         * the set of all integer points in the intersection of the
         * original cone with this linear subspace.  The resulting list
         * of basis vectors will contain no duplicates or redundancies.
         *
         * The parameter \a constraints may contain a set of validity
         * constraints, in which case this routine will only return \e valid
         * basis elements.  Each validity constraint is of the form "at
         * most one of these coordinates may be non-zero"; see the
         * EnumConstraints class for details.  These contraints have the
         * important property that, although validity is not preserved under
         * addition, \e invalidity is.
         *
         * \pre The template argument RayClass is derived from Ray (or
         * may possibly be Ray itself).
         *
         * \warning For normal surface theory, the Contejean-Devie algorithm is
         * extremely slow, even when modified to incorporate admissibility
         * constraints.  Consider using the much faster HilbertPrimal or
         * HilbertDual instead.
         *
         * @param results the output iterator to which the resulting basis
         * elements will be written; this must accept objects of type
         * <tt>RayClass*</tt>.

         * with the given cone.  Each row of this matrix is the equation
         * for one of the hyperplanes whose intersection forms this linear
         * subspace.  The number of columns in this matrix must be the
         * dimension of the overall space in which we are working.
         * @param constraints a set of validity constraints as described
         * above, or 0 if no additional constraints should be imposed.
