/**
 * Implements a modified primal algorithm for enumerating Hilbert bases.
 * This incorporates the primal algorithm described in
 * "Normaliz: Algorithms for affine monoids and rational cones",
 * Winfried Bruns and Bogdan Ichim, J. Algebra 324 (2010), 1098-1113,
 * and has been modified to allow for additional constraints (such as
 * the quadrilateral constraints from normal surface theory).
 *
 * To summarise: the algorithm first enumerates extremal rays of the rational
 * cone, and then decomposes the admissible region of the cone (where the
 * extra constraints are satisfied) into maximal admissible faces.
 * It calls Normaliz directly to enumerate the Hilbert basis for
 * each maximal admissible faces, and finally combines these into a basis
 * for the entire space.
 *
 * All routines of interest within this class are static; no object of
 * this class should ever be created.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.

        /**
         * Determines the Hilbert basis that generates all integer
         * points in the intersection of the <i>n</i>-dimensional
         * non-negative orthant with some linear subspace.
         * The resulting basis elements will be of the class \a RayClass,
         * will be newly allocated, and will be written to the given output
         * iterator.  Their deallocation is the responsibility of whoever
         * called this routine.
         *
         * The intersection of the non-negative orthant with this linear
         * subspace is a pointed polyhedral cone with apex at the origin,
         * and this routine requires the extremal rays of this cone to
         * be provided as input.  The extremal rays can be computed
         * using DoubleDescription::enumerate() in general cases,
         * though sometimes (such as with normal surface theory) more
         * efficient methods are available.
         *
         * This routine computes the Hilbert basis of all integer points in
         * this cone.  The resulting list of basis vectors will contain
         * no duplicates or redundancies.
         *
         * The parameter \a constraints may contain a set of validity
         * constraints, in which case this routine will only return \e valid
         * basis elements.  Each validity constraint is of the form "at
         * most one of these coordinates may be non-zero"; see the
         * EnumConstraints class for details.  These contraints have the
         * important property that, although validity is not preserved under
         * addition, \e invalidity is.
         *
         * An optional progress tracker may be passed.  If so, this routine
         * will update the percentage progress and poll for cancellation
         * requests.  It will be assumed that an appropriate stage has already
         * been declared via ProgressTracker::newStage() before this routine
         * is called, and that ProgressTracker::setFinished() will be
         * called after this routine returns.
         *
         * \pre If \a constraints is passed, then the given list of
         * extremal rays contains \e only those extremal rays that satisfy
         * all of the given constraints.
         * \pre The template argument RayClass is derived from Ray (or
         * may possibly be Ray itself).
         * \pre The template argument RayIterator is a forward iterator type,
         * and when dereferenced can be cast to (const Ray&).
         *
         * \warning If a progress tracker is passed, be aware that the
         * present implementation updates percentage progress very infrequently,
         * and may take a very long time to honour cancellation requests.
         *
         * @param results the output iterator to which the resulting basis
         * elements will be written; this must accept objects of type
         * <tt>RayClass*</tt>.
         * @param raysBegin an iterator pointing to the beginning of the
         * list of extremal rays.
         * @param raysEnd an iterator pointing past the end of the
         * list of extremal rays.
         * @param constraints a set of validity constraints as described
         * above, or 0 if no additional constraints should be imposed.
         * @param tracker a progress tracker through which progress
         * will be reported, or 0 if no progress reporting is required.
