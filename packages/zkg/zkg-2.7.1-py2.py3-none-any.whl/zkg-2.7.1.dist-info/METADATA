Zeek Package Manager
====================

The Zeek Package Manager makes it easy for Zeek users to install and
manage third party scripts as well as plugins for Zeek and ZeekControl.
The command-line tool is preconfigured to download packages from the
`Zeek package source`_ , a GitHub repository that has been set up such
that any developer can request their Zeek package be included. See the
``README`` file of that repository for information regarding the package
submission process.

:note: It's left up to users to decide for themselves via code review,
       GitHub comments/stars, or other metrics whether any given package
       is trustworthy as there is no implied guarantees that it's secure
       just because it's been accepted into the default package source.

See the package manager documentation_ for further usage information,
how-to guides, and walkthroughs.  For offline reading, it's also
available in the ``doc/`` directory of the source code distribution.
