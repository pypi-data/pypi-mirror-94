# Reinforcement Learning Environments for Yahtzee
This repo contains all of the source code for a basic environment to support training various RL agents to maximize their score in a game of Yahtzee. It is built on top of the Yahtzee API whose docs are found at https://yahtzee-api.tomarbeiter.com. 

Currently there is only 1 environment for a single player game of Yahtzee. Full documentation for the environment can be found at https://yahtzee-envs.tomarbeiter.com. It is modeled after the OpenAI framework, but is not fully compatible with the standard. 

### Installation
To install this package, run `pip install yahtzee-envs`
