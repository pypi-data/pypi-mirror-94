# strava-offline

## Overview

strava-offline is a tool to keep a local mirror of Strava activities for
further analysis/processing:

* synchronizes metadata about your bikes and activities to an [SQLite][]
  database

* downloads all your activities as [GPX][] (and supports not downloading [bulk
  exported][strava-bulk-export] activities again)

[SQLite]: https://www.sqlite.org/
[GPX]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format

Example of what you can do with the data:

## Installation

```
pipx ensurepath
pipx install --spec git+https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline strava-offline
```

To keep a local git clone around:

```
git clone https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline
make -C strava-offline pipx
```

Alternatively, if you don't need the isolated virtualenv that [pipx][]
provides, feel free to just:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/liskin/strava-offline
```

[pipx]: https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx

## Setup and usage

* Run `strava-offline sqlite`. The first time you do this, it will open Strava
  in a browser and ask for permissions. The token is then saved and it
  proceeds to sync activities metadata (this may take a couple dozen seconds
  the first time). Next time you run this, it uses the saved token and
  incrementally syncs latest activities (this takes a few seconds).

* Now you can use [sqlite3][] to query the activity database, which is placed
  at `~/.local/share/strava_offline/strava.sqlite` by default. Try for example:

  ```
  sqlite3 ~/.local/share/strava_offline/strava.sqlite \
    "SELECT CAST(SUM(distance)/1000 AS INT) || ' km' FROM activity"
  ```

* For GPX downloading, you'll need to get the `_strava4_session` cookie from
  your web browser session. Open <https://strava.com/> in your browser and
  then follow a guide for your browser to obtain the cookie value:

  * [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/cookies)
  * [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector)
  * [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/storage/cookies)

* You may also need to obtain your own Client ID and Client Secret from
  <https://www.strava.com/settings/api> because the built-in ID/Secret is
  shared with other users and may hit [rate limits][] (HTTP 429 Too Many
  Requests). Pass these as `--client-id` and `--client-secret` command line
  arguments or export as `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` and `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`
  environment variables.

  Alternatively, you may just wait a couple minutes and try again, but the
  rate limits are rather strict, so in the unlikely event this tool gets
  popular, serious users will have to get their own API application
  registered.

  (That settings page also lists Your Access Token but this won't let you
  download private activities or see names of bikes. Therefore its use is not
  supported in strava-offline.)

### Mirror activities metadata

```
$ strava-offline sqlite --help
usage: strava-offline sqlite [-h] [--client-id XXX] [--client-secret XXX]
                             [--token-file FILE] [--http-host HOST]
                             [--http-port PORT] [--full] [--database FILE]

Synchronize bikes and activities metadata to local sqlite3 database. Unless
--full is given, the sync is incremental, i.e. only new activities are
synchronized and deletions aren't detected.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --full               perform full sync instead of incremental

Strava API:
  --client-id XXX      strava oauth2 client id (default:
                       getenv('STRAVA_CLIENT_ID') or a built-in default)
  --client-secret XXX  strava oauth2 client secret (default:
                       getenv('STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET') or a built-in default)
  --token-file FILE    strava oauth2 token store (default:
                       /home/user/.config/strava_offline/token.json)
  --http-host HOST     oauth2 http server host (default: 127.0.0.1)
  --http-port PORT     oauth2 http server port (default: 12345)

strava-offline database:
  --database FILE      sqlite database file (default:
                       /home/user/.local/share/strava_offline/strava.sqlite)
```

### Mirror activities as GPX

**Important:** To avoid overloading Strava servers (and possibly getting
noticed), first download all your existing activities using the [Bulk Export
feature of Strava][strava-bulk-export]. Then use `--dir-activities-backup` at
least once to let strava-offline reuse these downloaded files.

[strava-bulk-export]: https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export#Bulk

```
$ strava-offline gpx --help
usage: strava-offline gpx [-h] [--strava4-session XX] [--dir-activities DIR]
                          [--dir-activities-backup DIR] [--database FILE]

Download known (previously synced using the "sqlite" command) activities in
GPX format. It's recommended to only use this incrementally to download the
latest activities every day or week, and download the bulk of your historic
activities directly from Strava. Use --dir-activities-backup to avoid
downloading activities already downloaded in the bulk.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Strava web:
  --strava4-session XX  '_strava4_session' cookie value (default:
                        getenv('STRAVA_COOKIE_STRAVA4_SESSION'))

strava-offline gpx storage:
  --dir-activities DIR  directory to store gpx files indexed by activity id
                        (default: strava_data/activities)
  --dir-activities-backup DIR
                        optional path to activities in Strava backup (no need
                        to redownload these)

strava-offline database:
  --database FILE       sqlite database file (default:
                        /home/user/.local/share/strava_offline/strava.sqlite)
```
