    def bump_fee(self, txid: str, options=None) -> dict:

        Bumps the fee of an opt-in-RBF transaction T, replacing it with a new transaction B. An opt-in RBF transaction
        with the given txid must be in the wallet. The command will pay the additional fee by decreasing
        (or perhaps removing) its change output. If the change output is not big enough to cover the increased fee,
        the command will currently fail instead of adding new inputs to compensate. (A future implementation could
        improve this.) The command will fail if the wallet or mempool contains a transaction that spends one of T’s
        outputs. By default, the new fee will be calculated automatically using estimatesmartfee. The user can specify
        a confirmation target for estimatesmartfee. Alternatively, the user can specify totalFee, or use RPC settxfee
        to set a higher fee rate. At a minimum, the new fee rate must be high enough to pay an additional new relay fee
        (incrementalfee returned by getnetworkinfo) to enter the node’s mempool.

        Parameters

                                be left unchanged from the original. If false, any input sequence numbers in the
                                original transaction that were less than 0xfffffffe will be increased to 0xfffffffe
                                so the new transaction will not be explicitly bip-125 replaceable (though it may
