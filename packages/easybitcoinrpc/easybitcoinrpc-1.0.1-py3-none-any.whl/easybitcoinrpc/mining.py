        If the request parameters include a ‘mode’ key, that is used to explicitly select between the default

        For full specification, see BIPs 22, 23, 9, and 145:

        Parameters
        -------
        template_request : dict
            A json object in the following spec

        Pass in [blocks] to override # of blocks, -1 specifies since last difficulty change.
        Pass in [height] to estimate the network speed at the time when a certain block was found.

        Parameters
        -------
        nblocks : int
            The number of blocks, or -1 for blocks since last difficulty change.

        height : int
            To estimate at the time of the given height.

        Accepts the transaction into mined blocks at a higher (or lower) priority

        -------

            The transaction id.

        dummy : int
            API-Compatibility for previous API. Must be zero or null.
            DEPRECATED. For forward compatibility use named arguments and omit this parameter.

        fee_delta : int
            The fee value (in satoshis) to add (or subtract, if negative).
            Note, that this value is not a fee rate. It is a value to modify absolute fee of the TX.
            The fee is not actually paid, only the algorithm for selecting transactions into a block considers
            the transaction as it would have paid a higher (or lower) fee
