Summary: A general purpose API to play an n-player game of Yahtzee
                    programmatically. Useful for algorithm development,
                    intended for future use with RL environments.

Description: Welcome to the Yahtzee API! This package provides the
                                core functionalities to programmatically play a game of
                                Yahtzee. The stated purpose of this package is for use
                                with reinforcement learning environments
                                (in development), however it is generalized for many
                                different use cases, including simple algorithm
                                development. As this is the first full iteration of
                                this API, I will likely be reworking/adding to
                                some of the core functionalities to suit my needs
                                as I do more work on the RL front.
