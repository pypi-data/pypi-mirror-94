## Attention Network Test (ANT)

The Attention Network Test (ANT) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting,
and executive attention based on the difference in reaction time of pressing a
key indicating the direction of the central arrow. This implementation of ANT is
based on Fan *et al.* (2002).

- To start only ANT, run `psychometric_tests_ant`.

## Remote Associates Test (RAT)

The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is sometimes used as measure of creative
potential by assessing a person's ability to think of fourth word that is
somehow related to the three words presented. English questions from Bowden &
Jung-Beeman (2003) and Japanese questions from Terai, Miwa & Asami (2013) are
included.

- To start only RAT, run `psychometric_tests_rat`.

## N-Back

The N-Back task is commonly used to assess part of working memory.

- To start only N-Back, run `psychometric_tests_nback`.
