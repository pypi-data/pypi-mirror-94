Description: xmldirector.connector
        =====================
        
        
        ``xmldirector.connector`` integrates  Plone 5 with 
        
        - local filesystem
        - WebDAV-backed backend
        - AWS S3
        - remote servers over SFTP/SSH
        
        ``xmldirector.connector`` provides a ``Connector`` content-type that
        mounts a particular storage into Plone. 
        
        No support for indexing and search mounted content.
        
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Plone 5.2 with Python 3.6 or higher (tested)
        
        - Supported backends:
        
            - eXist-db 
        
            - Base-X 
        
            - OwnCloud
            
            - Alfresco
        
            - Marklogic Server
        
            - AWS S3
        
            - Cloud federation services
        
              - Otixo.com
              - Storagemadeeasy.com
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Goto the Plone control panel and click on the ``XML-Director Connector`` configlet and
        configure the your service
        
        ExistDB
        +++++++
          
        - `webdav://localhost:6080/existdb/webdav/db`
        - username and password required to access your XML database over WebDAV
        
        BaseX
        +++++
        
        - `webdav://localhost:8984/webdav`                                     
        - username and password required to access your XML database over WebDAV
        
        Owncloud
        ++++++++
        
        - `webdav://hostname:port/remote.php/webdav`
        - username and password required to access your Owncloud instance over WebDAV
        
        Alfresco
        ++++++++
        
        - `webdav://hostname:port/webdav`
        - username and password required to access your Alfresco instance over WebDAV
        
        Local filesystem
        ++++++++++++++++
        
        - `file:///path/to/some/directory`
        - no support for credentials, the referenced filesystem must be readable (and writable)
        
        AWS S3
        ++++++
            
        - `s3://bucketname`
        - enter your AWS access key as username and the AWS secret key as password
          (You need to install the Python package `fs-s3fs` through buildout).
        
        SSH/SFTP
        ++++++++
        
        - `ssh://hostname.com` or `sftp://hostname.com`
          (You need to install the Python package `fs.sshfs` through buildout).
        
        
        
        API notes
        +++++++++
        
        The implementation of `xmldirector.connector` is heavily backed by the PyFilesystem 2 API.
        Every `Connector` instance in Plone gives you access to the mounted storage through the 
        `handle = connector.get_handle()` call which is instance of `fs.base.FS`. Check
        https://docs.pyfilesystem.org for details.
        
        Compatiblity with rclone
        ------------------------
        
        An alternative to using native drivers under the hood, using `rclone`
        (https://rclone.org/) is meanwhile perhaps the better solution. `rclone` is an
        application (a commandline utility) to interact with up to 40 different storage
        systems out of the box. `rclone` also allows you to mount different storages
        directly into your filesystem (tested on Linux but supposed to work on Mac and
        Windows too).  So for example, you can mount your Dropbox and Google Drive
        storages into your local filesystem under `/mnt/dropbox` and `/mnt/drive` and
        point your connector instances to `file:///mnt/dropbox` and
        `file:///mnt/drive`.  So any interaction would happen through the filesystem
        driver of Pyfilesystem. The underlying communication with the Dropbox or Google
        Drive API would be handled by `rclone` under the hood.
        
        Security
        ++++++++
        
        The mounted storage gives you access to all contents inside the mounted
        subtree.  The mounted filesystem is sandboxed
        (https://docs.pyfilesystem.org/en/latest/concepts.html#sandboxing). So you can
        not escape and access content outside the mounted storage.
        
        Available drivers
        +++++++++++++++++
        
        Connectivity with other backend is accomplished through dedicated driverse that implementation
        the API layer between PyFilesystem 2 and the related backend. 
        See https://www.pyfilesystem.org/page/index-of-filesystems/ for all available drivers.
