    Compute probability of state distinguishability [ELD03]_.

    The "quantum state distinguishability" problem involves a collection of :math:`n` quantum states

    .. math::
        \rho = \{ \rho_0, \ldots, \rho_n \},

    as well as a list of corresponding probabilities

    .. math::
        p = \{ p_0, \ldots, p_n \}.

    Alice chooses :math:`i` with probability :math:`p_i` and creates the state :math:`\rho_i` Bob
    wants to guess which state he was given from the collection of states.

    One can specify the distinguishability method using the :code:`dist_method` argument.

    For :code:`dist_method = "min-error"`, this is the default method that yields the probability of
    distinguishing quantum states that minimize the probability of error.

    For :code:`dist_method = "unambiguous"`, Alice and Bob never provide an incorrect answer,
    although it is possible that their answer is inconclusive.

    When :code:`dist_method = "min-error"`, this function implements the following semidefinite
    program that provides the optimal probability with which Bob can conduct quantum state
    distinguishability.

    .. math::
        \begin{align*}
            \text{maximize:} \quad & \sum_{i=0}^n p_i \langle M_i, \rho_i \rangle \\
            \text{subject to:} \quad & M_0 + \ldots + M_n = \mathbb{I},\\
                                     & M_0, \ldots, M_n \geq 0
        \end{align*}

    When :code:`dist_method = "unambiguous"`, this function implements the following semidefinite
    program that provides the optimal probability with which Bob can conduct unambiguous quantum
    state distinguishability.

    .. math::
        \begin{align*}
            \text{maximize:} \quad & \sum_{i=0}^n p_i \langle M_i, \rho_i \rangle \\
            \text{subject to:} \quad & M_0 + \ldots + M_{n+1} = \mathbb{I},\\
                                     & \langle M_i, \rho_j \rangle = 0,
                                       \quad 1 \leq i, j \leq n, \quad i \not= j.
                                     & M_0, \ldots, M_n \geq 0
        \end{align*}

    Examples
    ==========

    State distinguishability for two state density matrices.

    >>> from toqito.states import basis, bell
    >>> from toqito.state_opt import state_distinguishability
    >>> e_0, e_1 = basis(2, 0), basis(2, 1)
    >>> e_00 = e_0 * e_0.conj().T
    >>> e_11 = e_1 * e_1.conj().T
    >>> states = [e_00, e_11]
    >>> probs = [1 / 2, 1 / 2]
    >>> res = state_distinguishability(states, probs)
