def perfect_matchings(num: Union[List[int], int, np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""
    Give all perfect matchings of :code:`num` objects.

    Returns all perfect matchings of a given list of objects. That is, it returns all ways of
    grouping an even number of objects into pairs.

    This function is adapted from QETLAB.

    Examples
    ==========

    This is an example of how to generate all perfect matchings of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.

    >>> perfect_matchings(4)
    [[1 2 3 4]
     [1 3 2 4]
     [1 4 3 2]]

    :param num: Either an even integer, indicating that you would like all perfect matchings of the
                integers 1,2, ... N, or a `list` or `np.array` containing an even number of distinct
                entries, indicating that you would like all perfect matchings of those entries.
    :return: An array containing all valid perfect matchings of size :code:`num`.
