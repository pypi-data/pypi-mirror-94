    Determine whether there exists a symmetric extension for a given quantum state. [DPS02]_.

    Determining whether an operator possesses a symmetric extension at some level :code:`level`
    can be used as a check to determine if the operator is entangled or not.

    This function was adapted from QETLAB.

    Examples
    ==========

    2-qubit symmetric extension:

    In [CJKLZB14]_, it was shown that a 2-qubit state :math:`\rho_{AB}` has a
    symmetric extension if and only if

    .. math::
        \text{Tr}(\rho_B^2) \geq \text{Tr}(\rho_{AB}^2) - 4 \sqrt{\text{det}(\rho_{AB})}.

    This closed-form equation is much quicker to check than running the semidefinite program.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.state_props import has_symmetric_extension
    >>> rho = np.array([[1, 0, 0, -1],
    >>>                 [0, 1, 1/2, 0],
    >>>                 [0, 1/2, 1, 0],
    >>>                 [-1, 0, 0, 1]])
    >>> # Show the closed-form equation holds
    >>> np.trace(partial_trace(rho, 1)**2) >= np.trace(rho**2) - 4 * np.sqrt(np.linalg.det(rho))
    True
    >>> # Now show that the `has_symmetric_extension` function recognizes this case.
    >>> has_symmetric_extension(rho)
    True

    Higher qubit systems:

    Consider a density operator corresponding to one of the Bell states.

    .. math::
        \rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
                            1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
                            0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                            0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                            1 & 0 & 0 & 1
                           \end{pmatrix}

    To make this state over more than just two qubits, let's construct the following state

    .. math::
        \sigma = \rho \otimes \rho.

    As the state :math:`\sigma` is entangled, there should not exist a symmetric extension at some
    level. We see this being the case for a relatively low level of the hierachy.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from toqito.states import bell
    >>> from toqito.state_props import has_symmetric_extension
    >>>
    >>> rho = bell(0) * bell(0).conj().T
    >>> sigma = np.kron(rho, rho)
    >>> has_symmetric_extension(sigma)
    False
