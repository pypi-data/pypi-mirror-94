Demultiplexing requires two count matrices (variant-by-cell) of reads or UMIs 
for each variant in each cell: ``AD`` for alternative allele and ``DP`` depth 
(i.e., summary of alternative and reference alleles). These two matrices can be 
obtained by genotyping a list of variants in each cell. We provide a guideline 
for cellular genotyping_ with a recommendation of cellSNP_ that is developed by 
us, too.

Once the genotypes for each cell have been obtained, e.g., in VCF format, or two
sparse matrices ``AD`` and ``DP``, we can apply Vireo for demultiplexing.


Demultiplexing for donors
=========================

By default, Vireo works without any known genotype information for pooled 
samples. However, if any of genotype of these samples are known or can be 
obtained, e.g., by bulk RNA-seq, exome-seq, it is still useful to add them, not
only allowing us to align the deconvoluted samples to its identity, but also can 
benefits the doublets identification, especially if the coverage or the loaded 
cells per sample is low.

Depending the availability of genotype information, we provide four strategies 
to demultiplex scRNA-seq data.

1) without any genotype: 

   ::

      vireo -c $CELL_DATA -N $n_donor -o $OUT_DIR

2) with genotype for all samples (genoTag: GT, GP, or PL; default is PL, please 
   choose the existing one)

   ::

      vireo -c $CELL_DATA -d $DONOR_GT_FILE -o $OUT_DIR

   Optionally, `-N` can be provided if it is samller than that in DONOR_GT_FILE
   for finding the relevant subset of donors.

   **Note** For efficient loading of donor VCF file, we recommend subset it
   ``bcftools view donor.vcf.gz -R cellSNP.cells.vcf.gz -Oz -o sub.vcf.gz``
   Also, add ``-s`` or ``-S`` for subsetting samples. 

3) with genotype for part of the samples (n_donor is larger than that in 
   DONOR_GT_FILE)

   ::

      vireo -c $CELL_DATA -d $DONOR_GT_FILE -o $OUT_DIR -N $n_donor 

4) with genotype but not confident (or only for subset of SNPs)

   ::

      vireo -c $CELL_DATA -d $DONOR_GT_FILE -o $OUT_DIR --forceLearnGT


Formats of cell data
--------------------
Viroe supports the cell data in three formats:

1) a cellSNP output folder containing VCF for variants info and sparse matrices 
   ``AD`` and ``DP``
2) Vartrix outputs with three or four files: alt.mtx,ref.mtx,barcodes.tsv[,SNP.vcf.gz]
3) standard VCF file with variants by cells


Vireo full arguments
--------------------

Type ``vireo -h`` for details of all arguments:

Discriminatory variants
=======================

Given a set of variants for which estimated genotypes are available, the Vireo 
software implements a heuristic to define a minimal and informative set of 
discriminatory variants. This set of variants can be used to perform qPCR-based 
genotyping or for other targeted genoytping methods. Briefly, this algorithm 
prioritises variants with largest information gain in splitting samples.

For any donor genotype file in VCF format, especially the output from Vireo, 
``GT_donors.vireo.vcf.gz``, the ``GTbarcode`` function can be used to generate 
the minimal set of discriminatory variants by the following command line:

::

   GTbarcode -i $dir/GT_donors.vireo.vcf.gz -o $dir/GT_barcodes.tsv --randSeed 1

By default, this function filters out variants with <20 UMIs or >0.05 reads 
aligned other alleles except the annotated reference and alternative alleles. 
In case the variants with homozygous alternative alleles are not wanted, the 
arguments ``--noHomoAlt`` can be used. By default, this ``GTbarcode`` function 
will also generate a figure for the identified genotype barcode, as following 
(based on example data in the repo),

.. image:: image/GT_barcodes.png
   :height: 400px
   :width: 800px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: identified discriminatory variants
   :align: center


Example data
============

In order to test vireo and illustrate the usage, we provide a test `data set`_,
also some `demo scripts`_.

This example data set contains 952 cells from 4 samples. The genotypes for these
four samples are also provided.
