Description: # About
        This repository provides various functions useful for python and machine learning. The goal is to keep your code cleaner, keeping business logic out of your primary functions. For example, formatting paths is common, can often turn into many lines of code, and is done frequently throughout a script. Often people do the path formatting multiple times, mid-function, convoluting the code and distracting from the functions purpose. Further, paths aren't always formatted consistently and error handling is poor. Thus, I created the following function to format all paths consistently:
        
        ```python
        def format_path(path):
          """ Format paths into a consistent format. Expand user paths.
              Relative paths are converted to full paths. Directories 
              should all end in forward slashes. Note this will format even if
              the paths don't actually exist yet.
          Args:
            path: Full or relative path of directory or file in question.
          Returns:
            Formatted full paths, relative to 
          """
          # If path is None (e.g. when no --arg from parser), default to same dir as the script
          if path is None:
            path = ""
        
          # Expand paths
          path = os.path.expanduser(path)
        
          # Handle relative paths
          path = os.path.abspath(path)
        
          # Check if path *could be* a valid file or dir 
          # Note, files like MAKE or LICENCE that don't actually exist
          # will be considered as dirs.
          is_dir = os.path.isdir(path) or is_dir_like(path) and not os.path.isfile(path)
        
          # Make sure dirs end with a slash
          if is_dir and not path.endswith('/'):
            path += "/"
        
          return path  
        ```
        
        This function can take relative or full paths to files or directories. It ensures that empty paths and paths that are type None are handled, paths are expanded, and that directories end with a trailing slash. Using this function removes clutter from your other functions and ensures that paths are formatted consistently, resulting in cleaner, more robust code.
        
        A common machine learning example is writing detections to a textfile. This often involves multiple loops of a nested list. With pymltools, this can conveniently be done in one, self-evident line `write_label(path, labels)` rather than having to include a business-logic heavy method:
        
        ```python
        def write_label(path, labels, mode='w+', precision=6):
          """ Write the list to the file at specified full path.
              Create the file if it doesn't exist.
          Args:
            path: Full path to label file.
            bbox_list: List of yolo bboxes to be written in format:
                       [class, center_x, center_y, width, height]
            mode: The mode of writing.
            precision: How many decimal places to keep for bbox.
          Return:
            True on completion.
          """
          file = open(path, mode)
        
          # Write all lines to file
          for label in labels:
            # Line to be written to file
            line = ""
        
            for item in label:
              line += str(round(item, precision)) + " "
        
            line = line.strip()
            file.write(f"{line}\n")
        
          file.close()
          return True
        ```
        
        # How to Install
        Install the package  
        `pip install pymlutils`
        
        For dev, make sure you install the dev requirements
