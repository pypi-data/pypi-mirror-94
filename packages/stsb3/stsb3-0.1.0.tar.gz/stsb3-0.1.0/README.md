# `stsb3`

`stsb3` is a library for white-box, composable structural time series modeling and forecasting. `stsb` stands for "structural time series blocks" because the library contains building blocks from which you can construct expressive models. The `3` is because this is the third time I have recreated this library; each time represents an incremental improvement. [Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06865) are collections of random variables that together describe a time series model that ranges from abstract to concrete.
