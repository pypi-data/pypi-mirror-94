Description: # Genomics Extension for SQLite
        
        **("GenomicSQLite")**
        
        This [SQLite3 loadable extension](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html) adds features supporting applications in genome bioinformatics:
        
        * genomic range indexing for overlap queries & joins
        * streaming storage compression (also available [standalone](https://github.com/mlin/sqlite_zstd_vfs))
        * pre-tuned settings for "big data"
        
        Notice: this project is not associated with the SQLite developers.
