# WawPybus

### A package providing tools to collect, process and analyse Warsaw Open Bus Data

##### A final project for Database and network design and administration classes

## Installation

Package is available at PyPi and can be downloaded using pip:    
``
pip install wawpybus  
``

PyPi project: https://pypi.org/project/wawpybus/    
Source code: https://gitlab.uw.edu.pl/ig386329/pybus    


## Usage  
Package is designed to collect, process and analyse Warsaw open bus data. It is easy to use and handy.
It is modular and highly extendable       
* It enables downloading bus position withing given time range and frequency    
* Compares bus positions at given time with stops coordinates  
* Checks buses punctuality by downloading timetable for bus line at stop and compare arrival times between actual and timetable  
* Checks if buses exceeded speed between consecutive positions  
* Calculates mean difference in time between actual bus arrival and timetable  
* Finds bus which arrival time differs the most from timetable  
* Enables to check which buses exceeded given speed threshold  

Tutorial is included in package in a form of Jupyter Notebook: **WawPybus_tutorial.ipynb**      


## Comments on Warsaw Open Data  
Data available at https://api.um.warszawa.pl/# should be improved. It is inconsistent and contains errors.
For example once stop number is named in english once in polish as 'slupek', some stops coordinates are null, 
json returned from api has wrong structure - each key has name 'key' and respects to actual key name, 
the same with values.
