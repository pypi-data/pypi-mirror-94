Thermal Engineering Systems in Python
=====================================

TESPy stands for "Thermal Engineering Systems in Python" and provides a
powerful simulation toolkit for thermal engineering plants such as power
plants, district heating systems or heat pumps. It is an external extension
module within the `Open Energy Modelling Framework <https://oemof.org/>`_ and
can be used as a standalone package.

With the TESPy package you are able to calculate stationary operation in order
to design the process of thermal energy systems. From that point it is possible
to simulate the offdesign behavior of your plant using underlying
characteristics for each of the plants components. The package includes basic
components, such as turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, pipes,
mixers and splitters as well as some advanced components (derivatives of heat
exchangers, drum).

Everybody is welcome to use and/or develop TESPy. Contribution is already
possible on a low level by simply fixing typos in TESPy's documentation or
rephrasing sections which are unclear. If you want to support us that way
please fork the TESPy repository to your own github account and make changes
as described in the github guidelines:

Documentation
=============

You can find the full documentation at
`readthedocs <http://tespy.readthedocs.org>`_. Use the
`project site <http://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy>`_ of readthedocs to
choose the version of the documentation. Go to the
`download page <http://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy/downloads/>`_ to
download different versions and formats (pdf, html, epub) of the documentation.

To get the latest news visit and follow our `website <https://www.oemof.org>`_.

Installing TESPy
================

If you have a working Python3 environment, use pypi to install the latest
tespy version:

.. code:: bash

  pip install tespy

If you want to use the latest features, you might want to install the
**developer version**. See section
`Developing TESPy <http://tespy.readthedocs.io/en/dev/developing_tespy.html>`_
for more information. The developer version is not recommended for productive
use.

Examples
========

For a short introduction on how TESPy works and how you can use it, we provide
some
`examples and tutorials <https://tespy.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials_examples.html>`_,
go and check them out. You can download the python scripts of all example plants
from the
`tespy_examples <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-examples/tree/master/oemof_examples/tespy>`_
repository.
