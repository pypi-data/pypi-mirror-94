First steps
===========

In this section we provide you with a very simple example as firsts steps in
using TESPy. The model used in this introduction is shown the figure. It
consists of a central heating plant and a consumer, represented by a heat
exchanger with a control valve.

Set up a plant
--------------

In order to simulate a plant we start by creating a network
(:py:class:`tespy.networks.network.Network`). The network is the main container
for the model. You need to specify a list of the fluids you require for the
calculation in your plant. For more information on the fluid properties go to
the :ref:`corresponding section <tespy_fluid_properties_label>` in TESPy
modules.

.. code-block:: python

    from tespy.networks import Network

    # create a network object with water as fluid
    fluid_list = ['water']
    my_plant = Network(fluids=fluid_list)

On top of that, it is possible to specify a unit system and value ranges for
the network's variables. If you do not specify these, TESPy will use SI-units.
The specification of the **value range** is used to **improve convergence**
**stability**, in case you are dealing with **fluid mixtures**, e.g. using
combustion. We will thus only specify the unit systems, in this case.

.. code-block:: python

    # set the unitsystem for temperatures to Â°C and for pressure to bar
    my_plant.set_attr(T_unit='C', p_unit='bar', h_unit='kJ / kg')

Now you can start to create the components of the network.

Set up components
-----------------

The list of components available can be found
:ref:`here <using_tespy_components_label>`. If you set up a component you have
to specify a (within one network) unique label. Moreover, it is possible to
specify parameters for the component, for example power :math:`P` for a turbine
or upper terminal temperature difference :math:`ttd_\mathrm{u}` of a heat
exchanger. The full list of parameters for a specific component is stated in
the respective class documentation. The example uses pipes, a control valve and
a heat exchanger. The definition of the parameters available can be found here:

- :py:class:`tespy.components.piping.pipe.Pipe`
- :py:class:`tespy.components.piping.valve.Valve`
- :py:class:`tespy.components.heat_exchangers.heat_exchanger_simple.HeatExchangerSimple`

.. note::

    Parameters for components are generally optional. Only the component's
    label is mandatory. If an optional parameter is not specified by the user,
    it will be a result of the plant's simulation. This way, the set of
    equations a component returns is determined by which parameters you
    specify. You can find all equations in the components documentation as
    well.

.. code-block:: python

    from tespy.components import (
        Sink, Source, Pipe, Valve, HeatExchangerSimple)

    # sources & sinks (central heating plant)
    so = Source('heat source output')
    si = Sink('heat source input')

    # consumer
    cons = HeatExchangerSimple('consumer')
    cons.set_attr(Q=-10000, pr=0.98)  # Q in W
    val = Valve('valve')
    val.set_attr(pr=1)  # pr - pressure ratio (output/input pressure)

    # pipes
    pipe_feed = Pipe('pipe_feed')
    pipe_back = Pipe('pipe_back')

    pipe_feed.set_attr(ks=0.0005,  # pipe's roughness in meters
                       L=100,  # length in m
                       D=0.06,  # diameter in m
                       kA=10,  # area independent heat transfer coefficient kA in W/K
                       Tamb=10)  # ambient temperature of the pipe environment (ground temperature)
    pipe_back.set_attr(ks=0.0005,
                       L=100,
                       D=0.06,
                       kA=10,
                       Tamb=10)

After creating the components the next step is to connect them in order to form
your topological network.

Establish connections
---------------------

Connections are used to link two components (outlet of component 1 to inlet of
component 2: source to target). If two components are connected with each other
the fluid properties at the source will be equal to the properties at the
target. It is possible to set the properties on each connection in a similar
way as parameters are set for components. The basic specification options are:

 * mass flow (m)
 * volumetric flow (v)
 * pressure (p)
 * enthalpy (h)
 * temperature (T)
 * a fluid vector (fluid)

.. note::

    There are more specification options available. Please refer to
    the :ref:`connections section <using_tespy_connections_label>` in the TESPy
    modules chapter for detailed information. The specification options are
    stated in the
    connection class documentation, too:
    :py:class:`tespy.connections.connection.Connection`.

After creating the connections, we need to add them to the network. As the
connections hold the information, which components are connected in which way,
we do not need to pass the components to the network.

The connection parameters specified in the example case, are inlet and outlet
temperature of the system as well as the inlet pressure. The pressure losses in
the pipes, the consumer and the control valve determine the pressure at all
other points of the network. The enthalpy is calculated from given temperature
and heat losses in the pipes. Additionally we have to specify the fluid vector
at one point in our network.

.. code-block:: python

    from tespy.connections import Connection

    # connections of the disctrict heating system
    so_pif = Connection(so, 'out1', pipe_feed, 'in1')

    pif_cons = Connection(pipe_feed, 'out1', cons, 'in1')
    cons_val = Connection(cons, 'out1', val, 'in1')

    val_pib = Connection(val, 'out1', pipe_back, 'in1')
    pib_si = Connection(pipe_back, 'out1', si, 'in1')

    # this line is crutial: you have to add all connections to your network
    my_plant.add_conns(so_pif, pif_cons, cons_val, val_pib, pib_si)

    so_pif.set_attr(T=90, p=15, fluid={'water': 1})
    cons_val.set_attr(T=60)

Start your calculation
----------------------

After building your network, the components and the connections, add the
following line at the end of your script and run it:

.. code-block:: python

    my_plant.solve(mode='design')
    my_plant.print_results()

well as calculate offdesign/partload performance.
