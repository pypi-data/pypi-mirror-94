About TESPy
~~~~~~~~~~~

TESPy stands for "Thermal Engineering Systems in Python" and provides a
powerful simulation toolkit for thermal engineering plants such as power
plants, district heating systems or heat pumps. It is an external extension
module within the `Open Energy Modeling Framework <https://oemof.org/>`_ and
can be used as a standalone package.

With the TESPy package you are able to calculate stationary operation in order
to design the process of your plant. From that point it is possible to
predict the offdesign behavior of your plant using underlying characteristics
for each of the plants components. For now, the package includes basic
components, such as turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, pipes,
mixers and splitters as well as some advanced components
(derivatives of heat exchangers, drum).

Everybody is welcome to use and/or develop TESPy. Contribution is already
possible on a low level by simply fixing typos in TESPy's documentation or
rephrasing sections which are unclear. If you want to support us that way
please fork the TESPy repository to your own github account and make
changes as described in the github guidelines:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Quick installation
==================

If you have a working Python3 environment, use pypi to install the latest
tespy version.

.. code:: bash

    pip install tespy

We provide more detailed
:ref:`installation instructions <installation_and_setup_label>`, too.

If you want to use the latest features, you might want to install the
**developer version**. See section
:ref:`Developing TESPy <developing_tespy_label>` for more information.

Getting into TESPy
==================

For a good start on how TESPy works and how you can use it, we provide some
examples at the :ref:`examples section <tespy_examples_label>`. On top of that,
there is a step-by-step :ref:`tutorial <heat_pump_tutorial_label>` on how to
model a heat pump in TESPy.

The :ref:`TESPy modules section <tespy_modules_label>` provides you
with all important information on the different modules of TESPy.
