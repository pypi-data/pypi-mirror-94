API Fixes/Changes
#################
- Due to a bug/double structure in the network properties of a model,
  specification of component or connection parameters when the component or
  connection instance was accessed via its label within the network, the wrong
  copy of the instance was accessed when using PyGMO in some cases.
  The method off accessing components and connections via label has therefore
  changed in the following way.

  **Old method:**

  .. code-block:: python

      conn = mynetwork.connections['connection label']
      comp = mynetwork.components['component label']

  **New method:**

  .. code-block:: python

      conn = mynetwork.get_conn('connection label')
      comp = mynetwork.get_comp('component label')

  To iterate through all components or connections of the network use something
  like:

  .. code-block:: python

      for conn in mynetwork.conns['object']:
          print(conn.label)

      for comp in mynetwork.comps['object']:
          print(comp.label)

  **Accessing busses remains untouched**

Bug Fixes
#########
- Saving data of characteristics and reloading from the .csv file structure
  was broken if more than one component of the same class was part of the
  network (`PR #246 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/246>`_).
