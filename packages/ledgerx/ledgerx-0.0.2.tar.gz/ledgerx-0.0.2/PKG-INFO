Description: # LedgerX Python Client
        
        FYI - I don't have access to the trading API at the moment (it's only available to institutional accounts). LedgerX will be allowing retail in the future, at which point I plan to build out all API endpoints. In the meantime, if you're an institution and want to use this, get in touch with me and I'd be happy to build the trading portion of the client.
        
        ## example
        One of the many examples in the [examples](https://github.com/westonplatter/ledgerx-python/tree/main/examples) directory.
        
        ```
        from ledgerx import Trades
        
        data = Trades.list()
        
        print(f"Number of trades = {len(data['data'])}")
        print(f"Example trade = {data['data'][0]}")
        ```
        
        
        ## dev env
