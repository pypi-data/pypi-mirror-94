Budget Module
=============

Features:

* Create budget, budget items and budget versions.
* Budget versions are multi currencies and multi companies.

This module is for real advanced budget use, otherwise prefer to use the
OpenERP official one.

Active Budget Version
=====================

Every Budget has zero or one active Version. This is marked by a flag and that
can be set with a button. All other versions are disabled.

If a budget version is duplicated, the old one is automatically disabled as
well.
