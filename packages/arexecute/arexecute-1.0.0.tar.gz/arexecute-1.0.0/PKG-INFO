Description: # arexecute
        Application to record actions on the computer and then execute them in a controlled way.
        
        ## Installation
        
        arexecute is in pypi, run the following command to install:
        
        `python -m pip install arexecute`
        
        After installation, all commands that are run using the module as a direct application can be run using either one of the following commands:
        
        `python -m arexecute <arexecute-commands>`
        
        or:
        
        `arexecute <arexecute-commands>`
        
        For the examples we will stick to the second one.
        
        ## Recording
        
        To record into a file named "example.json", run the following line:
        
        `arexecute example`
        
        Here "example" can be a filename with a path different from the current directory,
        or it can be only a filename, either with the .json extension or without it.
        <br>
        The instructions for recording are the following:
        
        (->) Denotes press first one key, then the next
        | Command                              | Action                                                       |
        |--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
        | Alt                                  | Stop recording                                               |
        | W -> any number -> W                 | Add waiting time of seconds equal to the number              |
        | Caps Lock -> any string -> Caps Lock | Writes the string                                            |
        | Ctrl                                 | Move mouse to current mouse position                         |
        | Shift n times                        | Clicks n times in the last mouse position determined by Ctrl |
        | v                                    | Adds a variable to be defined later                          |
        <br/>
        In this way, one can record mouse movements, clicks, writing variables, etc.
        
        ## Executing
        
        To execute, run the following line:
        
        `arexecute example -e`
        
        This will execute the recorded example once. In order to run more than one time, add an integer after de -e flag.
        To run it indefinitely use the -r flag. In order for this command to work, a previous recording named "example.json" in the same
        directory, or in the one specified by the filename must exist.
        
        ## Using Variables
        
        When recording, typing 'v' will add a new variable in place. In order to define this variable, you can go to the json file, 'variable' key
        and replace the "var_placeholder" strings for the variable itself. In order to use different variables for different iterations, replace
        the same strings by lists of variables.
        
        ## Usage on a .py file
        
        To use this program in a python script, just import the functions start_recording
        and start_executing, this functions receive the file to execute/record to, and also
        other parameters associated that are analogous to the flags shown.
