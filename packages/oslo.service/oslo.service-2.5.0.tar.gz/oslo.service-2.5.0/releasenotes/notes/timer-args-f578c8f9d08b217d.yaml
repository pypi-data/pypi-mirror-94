features:
  - |
    The ThreadGroup class has new add_timer_args() and add_dynamic_timer_args()
    methods to create timers passing the positional and keyword arguments to
    the callback as a sequence and a mapping. This API provides more
    flexibility for the addition of timer control options in the future.
deprecations:
  - |
    The API of the ThreadGroup add_timer() and add_dynamic_timer() methods has
    been identified as error-prone when passing arguments intended for the
    callback function. Passing callback arguments in this way is now
    deprecated. Callers should use the new add_timer_args() or
    add_dynamic_timer_args() methods (respectively) instead when it is
    necessary to pass arguments to the timer callback function.
