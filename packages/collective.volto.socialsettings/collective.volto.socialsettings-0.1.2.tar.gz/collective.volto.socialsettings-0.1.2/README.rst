Add-on for manage a list of social network links on Volto

Features
--------

- Control panel for plone registry to manage social links settings.
- Restapi view that exposes these settings for Volto

Volto endpoint
--------------

Anonymous users can't access registry resources by default with plone.restapi (there is a special permission).

To avoid enabling registry access to everyone, this package exposes a dedicated restapi route with the list of social links: *@social-links*::

    > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/@social-links -H 'Accept: application/json'

And the result is something like this::

    [
        {
            "title":"foo",
            "icon": "bar",
            "url": "http://foo.com"
        },
        ...
    ]

Control panel
-------------

You can edit settings directly from Volto because the control has been registered on Plone and available with plone.restapi.
