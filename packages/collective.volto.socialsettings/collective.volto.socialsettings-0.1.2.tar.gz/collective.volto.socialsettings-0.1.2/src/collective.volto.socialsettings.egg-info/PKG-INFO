        Add-on for manage a list of social network links on Volto
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Control panel for plone registry to manage social links settings.
        - Restapi view that exposes these settings for Volto
        
        Volto endpoint
        --------------
        
        Anonymous users can't access registry resources by default with plone.restapi (there is a special permission).
        
        To avoid enabling registry access to everyone, this package exposes a dedicated restapi route with the list of social links: *@social-links*::
        
            > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/@social-links -H 'Accept: application/json'
        
        And the result is something like this::
        
            [
                {
                    "title":"foo",
                    "icon": "bar",
                    "url": "http://foo.com"
                },
                ...
            ]
        
        Control panel
        -------------
        
        You can edit settings directly from Volto because the control has been registered on Plone and available with plone.restapi.
