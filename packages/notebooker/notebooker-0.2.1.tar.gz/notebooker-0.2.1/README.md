Productionise your Jupyter Notebooks, just as interactively as you wrote them. Notebooker is a webapp which can execute and parametrise Jupyter Notebooks as soon as they have been committed to git. The results are stored in MongoDB and searchable via the web interface, essentially turning your Jupyter Notebook into a production-style web-based report in a few clicks.

## Getting started
See the documentation at [https://notebooker.readthedocs.io/](https://notebooker.readthedocs.io/) for installation instructions.

Notebooker has been tested on Linux, Windows 10, and OSX; the webapp has been tested on Google Chrome.

If you want to explore an example right away, you can use docker-compose:
```sh
cd docker
docker-compose up
```
That will expose Notebooker at http://localhost:8080/ with the example templates.
