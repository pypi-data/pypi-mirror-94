Goals
=====

Markus makes it easier to generate metrics in your program by:

* providing multiple backends (Datadog statsd, statsd, logging, logging rollup,
  and so on) for sending data to different places

* sending metrics to multiple backends at the same time

* providing a testing framework for easy testing

* providing a decoupled architecture making it easier to write code to generate
  metrics without having to worry about making sure creating and configuring a
  metrics client has been done--similar to the Python logging Python logging
  module in this way

I use it at Mozilla in the collector of our crash ingestion pipeline. Peter used
it to build our symbols lookup server, too.


Install
=======

To install Markus, run::

    $ pip install markus


(Optional) To install the requirements for the
``markus.backends.datadog.DatadogMetrics`` backend::

    $ pip install markus[datadog]


Quick start
===========

Similar to using the logging library, every Python module can create a
``markus.main.MetricsInterface`` (loosely equivalent to a Python
logging logger) at any time including at module import time and use that to
generate metrics.

For example::

    import markus

    metrics = markus.get_metrics(__name__)


Creating a ``markus.main.MetricsInterface`` using ``__name__``
will cause it to generate all stats keys with a prefix determined from
``__name__`` which is a dotted Python path to that module.

Then you can use the ``markus.main.MetricsInterface`` anywhere in that
module::

    @metrics.timer_decorator("chopping_vegetables")
    def some_long_function(vegetable):
        for veg in vegetable:
            chop_vegetable()
            metrics.incr("vegetable", value=1)


At application startup, configure Markus with the backends you want to use to
publish metrics and any options they require.

For example, lets configure metrics to publish to logs and Datadog::

    import markus

    markus.configure(
        backends=[
            {
                # Log metrics to the logs
                "class": "markus.backends.logging.LoggingMetrics",
            },
            {
                # Log metrics to Datadog
                "class": "markus.backends.datadog.DatadogMetrics",
                "options": {
                    "statsd_host": "example.com",
                    "statsd_port": 8125,
                    "statsd_namespace": ""
                }
            }
        ]
    )


When you're writing your tests, use the ``markus.testing.MetricsMock``
to make testing easier::

    from markus.testing import MetricsMock


    def test_something():
        with MetricsMock() as mm:
            # ... Do things that might publish metrics

            # Make assertions on metrics published
            mm.assert_incr_once("some.key", value=1)
