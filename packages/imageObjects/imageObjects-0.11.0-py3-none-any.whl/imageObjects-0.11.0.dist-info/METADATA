# imageObjects

This acts as an API of sorts for CV2, with some common methods cast into objects that work with images, contours and 
more. All source code at the [github repo page][repo]

### ContourObject
open-cv python has contours, a extremely useful component that can be extracted from images. However, these components 
are in a ndarray format that can then be processed by a list of methods, rather than an object which has a list of 
methods. This library changes that around and allows for the contour extracted via open cv python to be placed in an 
object which can then be manipulated. 

### ImageObject
There are lots of common image functions that have been mapped to images, so that a loaded image can have these as 
properties or as methods inherently rather than having to code them yourself.

### LineObject
This will search for lines within an ImageObject which you can then utilise as a mask or manipulate with ImageObjects

### ImageMaker
This can be used to make new ImageObjects, when you don't have anything to load or custom ImageObjects like text-boxes

### common
Whilst common is mostly designed for internal use, there are some common methods here that may save you re-defining them
yourself or from other packages
