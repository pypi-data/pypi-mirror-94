# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.5.0 (2021-02-13)

  displayed).

## 1.4.0 (2021-02-13)

## 1.3.0 (2021-02-13)

- Add support for changing the usage width via the `usage_width` option on the directive
- Mark document as always needs update (as the underlying content is coming from outside the sphinx documents)
- Help messages is now interpreted as reStructuredText
- Matching curly braces, single and double quotes in help text will be marked as string literals

  already documented in the help text)
