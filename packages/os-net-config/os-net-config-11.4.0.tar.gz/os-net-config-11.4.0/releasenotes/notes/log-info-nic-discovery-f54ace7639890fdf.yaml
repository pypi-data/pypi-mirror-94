    Getting the ordered, active, and available nics has been traditionally one
    of the parts of os-net-config that can cause issues due to either user
    error or bugs. There are helpful log messages to log what is going on in
    the logic, but it's all hidden behind the DEBUG log level.  These messages
    should be INFO instead of DEBUG. It's much more user friendly when there
    are issues instead of having to rerun with --debug.
