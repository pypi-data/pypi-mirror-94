    os-net-config always logs the message "Using mapping file at:
    /etc/os-net-config/mapping.yaml" even if the file does not exist, in which
    case it's not actually being used at all. Move the log message to only be
    shown if the mapping file actually exists and is used. In the case where no
    mapping file is used, also log a message indicating such.
