    Some changes can now be made to interfaces without restarting. Changes to
    routes, IP addresses, netmask, or MTU will now be applied using iproute2
    without restarting the interface, and the ifcfg file will be updated.

    Since this change uses iproute2 to make changes to live interfaces, it
    does not allow MTU on DPDK interfaces to be modified in place. DPDK
    requires that ovs-vsctl be run to modify MTU. For DPDK interfaces, MTU
    changes will result in an interface restart.
