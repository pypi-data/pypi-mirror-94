    Adds support to use ``destination`` and ``nexthop`` as keys in the
    ``Route`` objects. ``destination`` maps to ``ip_netmask`` and ``nexthop``
    maps to ``next_hop``. Neutron Route objects use ``destination`` and
    ``nexthop``, supporting the same schema allow passing a neutron route
    directly to os-net-config.
