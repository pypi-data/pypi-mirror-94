    Support for configuring policy-based routing has been added. A new
    top-level object "route_table" has been added, which allows the user to
    add tables to the system route table at /etc/iproute2/rt_tables. Routes
    have a new "table" property for specifying which table to apply the route.
    Interfaces now have a "rules" property that allows the user to add
    arbitrary rules for when the system should use a particular routing table,
    such as input interface or source IP address.
