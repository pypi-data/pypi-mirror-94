PCA-B-Stream: Byte Stream Representation of Piecewise-constant Array
====================================================================

Purpose of ``PCA-B-Stream``
===========================

In a Few Words
--------------

The ``PCA-B-Stream`` project allows to generate a printable `byte stream <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects>`_ representation of a piecewise-constant `Numpy array <https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>`_ and to re-create the array from the byte stream, similarly to what is available as part of the `COCO API <https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi>`_.



Illustration
------------

.. code-block:: python

    import pca_b_stream as pcas
    import numpy as nmpy
    # --- Array creation
    array = nmpy.zeros((10, 10), dtype=nmpy.uint8)
    array[1, 1] = 1
    # --- Array -> Byte stream -> Array
    stream = pcas.PCA2BStream(array)
    decoding = pcas.BStream2PCA(stream)
    # --- Check and print
    assert nmpy.array_equal(array, decoding)
    print(stream)

The generated byte stream is: b'FnmHoFain+3jtU'



.. _sct_motivations:

Motivations
===========

The motivations for developing an alternative to existing solutions are:

- Arrays can be of any dimension (i.e., not just 2-dimensional)
- Their `dtype <https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.dtype.html>`_ can be of kind boolean, integer, or float
- They can contain more than 2 distinct values (i.e., non-binary arrays) as long as the values are integers (potentially stored in a floating-point format though)
- The byte stream representation is self-contained; In particular, there is no need to keep track of the array shape *externally*
- The byte stream representation contains everything needed to re-create the array *exactly* as it was instantiated (``dtype``, endianness, C or Fortran ordering); See `note <note_on_exact>`_ though


.. _note_on_exact:

.. note::
    The statement "re-create the array *exactly* as it was instantiated" is over-confident. First this has not been fully tested by, for example, re-creating an array on a another machine with a different native endianness as the one it was originally instantiated on. Second, more work might be required to ensure that enumeration ordering is correctly dealt with.



Documentation
=============

Functions
---------

The project defines the following functions:

- ``PCA2BStream``
    - Generates the byte stream representation of an array; Does not check the array validity (see ``PCAIsValid``)
    - Input: a `Numpy ndarray <https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>`_
    - Output: an object of type `bytes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects>`_
- ``BStream2PCA``
    - Re-creates the array from its bytes stream representation; Does not check the stream format validity
    - Input/Output: input and output of ``PCA2BStream`` swapped
- ``PCAIsValid``
    - Checks whether an array is a valid input for stream representation generation; It is meant to be used before calling ``PCA2BStream``
    - Input: a `Numpy ndarray <https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>`_
    - Output: a tuple ``(validity, issue)`` where ``validity`` is a boolean and ``issue`` is None if ``validity`` is True, or a string describing why the array is considered invalid otherwise.
    - Additional information about what are valid piecewise-constant arrays here is provided in the `section "Motivations" <sct_motivations>`_.
- ``BStreamDetails``
    - Extract details from a byte stream representation; See `section "Byte Stream Format" <byte_stream_format>`_
    - Inputs:
        - a byte stream generated by ``PCA2BStream``
        - details: a string where each character corresponds to a detail to extract, or "+" to extract all of the available details; Default: "+"; Available details are:
            - m=maximum value in array (also number of sub-streams)
            - c=compression indicators (string of zeros and ones, one per sub-stream)
            - e=endianness
            - t=dtype type code
            - T=dtype name
            - o=enumeration order
            - v=first value (0 for 0 or False, 1 for non-zero or True)
            - d=array dimension
            - l=array lengths per dimension
        - should_print: a boolean to instruct whether the extracted details should be printed to console; Defaults: True
        - should_return: a boolean to instruct whether the extracted details should be returned (see Outputs); Defaults: False
    - Output: either one of:
        - None if should_return is False
        - a dictionary of all of the available details if the ``details`` parameter is "+"
        - a tuple of the requested details in the same order as in the ``details`` parameter



.. _byte_stream_format:

Byte Stream Format
------------------

A byte stream is a sequence of `base85-encoded (sub-)streams <https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html#base64.b85encode>`_ joined with newlines characters b'\n'.

For a boolean array or an array containing only 0's (zeros) and 1's (ones), there is only one such encoded stream. Once decoded, it has the following format (in lexicographical order; all characters are in ``bytes`` format):

- 0 or 1: indicates whether the remaining of the stream is in uncompressed or `ZLIB compressed <https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html#zlib.compress>`_ format; See `note on compression <note_on_compression>`_; The remaining of the description applies to the stream in the uncompressed "space"
- 3 characters "{E}{T}{O}":
    - E: endianness among "|", "<" and ">"
    - T: ``dtype`` character code among: "?" + numpy.typecodes["AllInteger"] + numpy.typecodes["Float"]
    - O: enumeration order among "C" (C-ordering) and "F" (Fortran-ordering)
- 0 or 1: whether the first value in the array is zero (or False) or one (or True)
- characters resulting from the `unsingned LEB128 encoding <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128#Unsigned_LEB128>`_ of some integers using the `leb128 project <https://github.com/mohanson/leb128>`_; These integers are:
    - one integer for the dimension of the array (1 for vectors, 2 for matrices, 3 for volumes...)
    - one integer per dimension giving the length of the array in that dimension
    - integers of the `run-length representation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding>`_ of the array read in its proper enumeration order

For arrays containing 3 distinct integer values or more (or if the maximum value is higher than 1 regardless of the number of distinct values), there is one encoded stream per value between 1 and the maximum value in the array. The first encoded stream format is identical to the binary case above. The format of the remaining streams is a version of the above format where information already known has been removed: the 3 characters "{E}{T}{O}" and the integers of the array dimension and the length per dimension.


.. _note_on_compression:

.. note::
    For small arrays, compressing the byte stream actually produces a longer stream.
