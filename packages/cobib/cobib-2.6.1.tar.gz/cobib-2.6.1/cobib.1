.SH DESCRIPTION
CoBib is a console-based bibliography manager written in Python.
It maintains a plain-text database of literature data in YAML format at
\fI$HOME/.local/share/cobib/literature.yaml\fR.
.PP
CoBib provides a variety of \fBSUBCOMMANDS\fR through which you may
investigate and manage the database.
For easy of use it also comes with a curses-based \fBTUI\fR which is
automatically started when no other subcommand is found (more information is
provided in that section).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Prints the version information and exits.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Prints a help message and exits.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Increases the verbosity level of the logging. This option may be provided up to
two times (increasing the logging to \fIinfo\fR and \fIdebug\fR, respectively).
By default, the verbosity of CoBib's CLI is set to \fIwarning\fR but if the TUI
is started, logging will be increased to \fIinfo\fR and redirected to
\fI/tmp/cobib.log\fR.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-config " " \fI<path>\fR
Run with an alternate configuration file at \fI<path>\fR.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-log " " \fI<path>\fR
Run with an alternate log file at \fI<path>\fR.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
All subcommands listed below also provide the \fI\-h\fR and \fI\-\-help\fR
options which provide additional information for each subcommand.
.TP
.B cobib init \fI<args>\fR
Initializes the literature database.
The path to this file can be configured in the \fIDATABASE\fR section of the
configuration file (see also \fBCONFIGURATION\fR).
The only available argument is:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-g ", " \-\-git
.in +4n
Initializes CoBib's integrated history tracking through git.
This command will preserve any existing database file, but it is a good idea to
make a backup before doing this, just in case.
Note, that in order to use this functionality you must also enable the
\fIDATABASE/git\fR configuration option (see also \fBCONFIGURATION\fR).
Also be sure to at least set a \fIname\fR and \fIemail\fR in the git config!
.TP
.B cobib add \fI<args>\fR ...
Adds a new entry to the database.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fItags\fR to associate with the
newly added entries.
The \fI<args>\fR may be any of the following:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-a ", " \-\-arxiv " " \fI<arxiv\ id>\fR
.in +4n
Adds an entry specified by the \fIarXiv\fR id.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-b ", " \-\-bibtex " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Adds the bibliography data from the \fIBibLaTex\fR file at the provided path.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-d ", " \-\-doi " " \fI<doi>\fR
.in +4n
Adds an entry specified by the \fIDOI\fR.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-i ", " \-\-isbn " " \fI<doi>\fR
.in +4n
Adds an entry specified by the \fIISBN\fR.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-f ", " \-\-file " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Associate the newly added entry with the \fIfile\fR at the provided path.
As of version 2.5 you can specify multiple files, too.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-l ", " \-\-label  " " \fI<label>\fR
.in +4n
Store the newly added entry under the specified \fIlabel\fR.
.TP
.B cobib delete \fI<label>\fR
Deletes the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR.
.TP
.B cobib edit \fI<label>\fR
Opens the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR in the \fI$EDITOR\fR.
The entry is copied verbatim in \fIYAML\fR format from and to the database file.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-a ", " \-\-add " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Allows editing a non-existing label to manually add it to the database.
.TP
.B cobib modify \fI<modification>\fR \fI<args>\fR ...
Applies a modification to multiple entries at once.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fBFILTERS\fR which the entries
must match in order to be modified \fIor\fR to provide a list of labels of the
entries which are to be modified (this requires the \fI-s\fR flag to be set).
The \fI<args>\fR may be any of the following:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \fI<modification>\fR
.in +4n
The modification must be provided in the format \fI<field>:<value>\fR and will
set the field of all selected entries to the given value.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-a ", " \-\-append
.in +4n
This is \fBNOT\fR implemented yet. However, in the future this will provide the
possibility to append the new value to the modified field rather than
overwriting it.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-s ", " \-\-selection
.in +4n
This boolean flag enables the \fIselection\fR mode in which the positional args
are interpreted as a list of labels which are to be exported. The name for this
argument is a result of the TUI's selection interface.
.TP
.B cobib undo \fI<args>\fR
If you enabled the git-integration of CoBib (available since v2.6.0) you can
undo the changes done to your database file by commands such as add, edit and
delete. See also \fIDATABASE/git\fR in the \fBCONFIGURATION\fR section for more
information.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-f ", " \-\-force
.in +4n
Overwrites the check for an auto-committed change. Thus, the undo command will
now undo the last commit with a message that does not start with "Undo".
.TP
.B cobib redo
If you enabled the git-integration of CoBib (available since v2.6.0) you can
reapply the last undone changes (see above). See also \fIDATABASE/git\fR in the
\fBCONFIGURATION\fR section for more information.
.TP
.B cobib open \fI<label>\fR
Opens any associated \fIfile\fR of the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR.
If multiple files are associated with the entry, the user can choose which file(s) to open through
an interactive menu.
.TP

Prints the entry with the given \fIlabel\fR in \fIBibLaTex\fR format to stdout.
.TP
.B cobib list \fI<args>\fR
Lists all entries of the database in a basic table format to stdout which match
the specified \fBFILTERS\fR (more information is provided in that section).
Additionally, the following \fI<args>\fR are also allowed:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-l ", " \-\-long
.in +4n
Print the table in \fIlong\fR format, i.e. without wrapping the lines to fit the
current terminal width.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-s ", " \-\-sort " " \fI<field>\fI
.in +4n
Specify the entry field to use as the \fIsorting column\fR of the table.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-r ", " \-\-reverse
.in +4n
Reverses the sorting order.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-x ", " \-\-or
.in +4n
Concatenate the filters using logical \fIOR\fR rather than the default
\fIAND\fR.
.TP
.B cobib search \fI<args>\fR ...
Searches the database recursively (i.e. including any associated files) for the
specified keyword.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fBFILTERS\fR which the entries
must match in order to be included in the export.
Additionally, the following \fI<args>\fR are also allowed:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-c ", " \-\-context " " \fI<int>\fI
.in +4n
Specify the number of context lines to provide for each match.
This values defaults to 1.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-i ", " \-\-ignore-case
.in +4n
Makes the search case-insensitive.
.TP
.B cobib export \fI<args>\fR ...
Exports the database.
The positional arguments may be used to provide \fBFILTERS\fR which the entries
must match in order to be included in the export \fIor\fR to provide a list of
labels of the entries which are to be exported (this requires the \fI-s\fR flag
to be set).
The \fI<args>\fR may be any of the following:
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-b ", " \-\-bibtex " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Export the entries to a \fIBibLaTex\fR file at the specified path.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-z ", " \-\-zip " " \fI<path>\fR
.in +4n
Export a \fIBibLaTex\fR file of the entries and all of the associated files into
a single \fIZIP\fR file at the specified path.
.PP
.in +8n
.BR \-s ", " \-\-selection
.in +4n
This boolean flag enables the \fIselection\fR mode in which the positional args
are interpreted as a list of labels which are to be exported. The name for this
argument is a result of the TUI's selection interface.
.SH FILTERS
In order to limit the output of the \fIlist\fR and \fIexport\fR commands you can
apply additional filters via keyword arguments.
Their availability depends on your database since they are added to the argument
parser at runtime.
However, you can find a full list for your specific case with \fIcobib list
\-\-help\fR.
.PP
The general syntax for filtering is the following
.in +8n
[\fB++\fR|\fB\-\-\fR]\fB<field>\fR \fI<value>\fR
.in
which is to be understood as the following:
When the keyword argument is started with \fB++\fR the entry must positively
\fImatch\fR this filter; if started with \fB\-\-\fR it must \fINOT\fR match.
The \fB<field>\fR may be any available field in your database.
It should be noted, that this string is matched exactly which means no plurals
are allowed.
The \fI<value>\fR finally specifies what is matched against.
.PP
In general, multiple filters provided to the \fIlist\fR and \fIexport\fR
commands are combined with logical \fIAND\fR.
This may be overwritten by adding the \fI\-x\fR or \fI\-\-or\fR arguments as
described in the arguments section of the \fIlist\fR command.
.SH EXAMPLES
This section provides a few examples of \fBFILTERS\fR as described above.
.TP
.B cobib list ++year 2020
Lists only entries which were published in 2020.
.TP
.B cobib list --tags chemistry
Lists only entries without the `chemistry` tag.

Lists only entries with the `quantum` tag from the year 2019.
.TP
.B cobib list -x ++year 2019 ++year 2020
Lists only entries published in 2019 or 2020.
.SH TUI
The curses-based TUI is started automatically when no other subcommand is
supplied, i.e. by simply running \fBcobib\fR.
By default, it lists all entries of the database in a buffer which may be
scrolled in vim-fashion with \fIh,j,k,l,^B,^U,^D,^F\fR.
The arrow and paging keys are also available for scrolling.
The following default key bindings are available:
.TP
.BR q " " quit
Quits one level of the viewing buffer.
.TP
.BR ? " " help
Opens a small window providing help for the key bindings.
.TP
.BR ENTER " " show
Populates the viewing buffer with a BibLaTex view of the selected entry.
.TP
.BR o " " open
Opens the current (or \fIselected\fR) label(s).
.TP
.BR w " " wrap
Toggles wrapping of the viewing buffer.
.TP
.BR a " " add
Opens a command prompt which allows running the \fBadd\fR command as if outside
of the TUI.

outside of the TUI. If a \fIselection\fR is present, the \fI-s\fR argument will
be set automatically.
.TP
.BR u " " undo
Undoes the last auto-committed change to the database file.
This requires the git-integration (since v2.6.0) to be enabled!
.TP
.BR r " " redo
Reapplies the last undone change.
This requires the git-integration (since v2.6.0) to be enabled!
.TP
.BR / " " search
Opens a search prompt and views the results in the viewing buffer.
.TP
.BR f " " filter
Allows adding filters to the list view.
.TP
.BR s " " sort
Allows sorting the list view.
.TP
.BR v " " select
Adds the current label to the \fIselection\fR.
.TP
.BR x " " export

outside of the TUI. If a \fIselection\fR is present, the \fI-s\fR argument will
be set automatically.
.TP
.BR : " " prompt
Opens a command prompt allowing the user to execute an arbitrary CoBib CLI command.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Cobib can be configured with an \fIINI\fR file placed at
\fI$HOME/.config/cobib/config.ini\fR
For more information on this file format take a look at
https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html
This section summarizes the sections and respective configuration options.
.PP
.BR [DATABASE]
.TP
.IR file = $HOME/.local/share/cobib/literature.yaml
Specifies the path to the database file.
.TP
.IR git = False
This boolean field indicates whether the database file should automatically be
tracked in a git repository.
Note, that you must initialize the git-tracking with \fIcobib init --git\fR. If
you already have an existing database file, it will be preserved. Nonetheless,
it is a good idea to make a backup before doing so, just in case.
Also be sure to at least set a \fIname\fR and \fIemail\fR in the git config!
.PP
.TP
.IR open = xdg-open " (on Linux); " open " (on Mac OS)"
Specifies the program used to open associated files.
.TP
.IR grep = grep
Specifies the program used to search in associated files.
.TP
.IR search_ignore_case = False
This boolean field indicates whether search defaults to be case-insensitive.
.PP
.BR [FORMAT]
.TP
.IR month = int
This field may either be \fIint\fR (default) or \fIstr\fR and it specifies the
type into which the \fBmonth\fR field should be converted before storing.
.TP
.IR ignore_non_standard_types = False
This boolean field indicates whether non-standard BibLaTex entry types should be
ignored or not.

This field indicates the default entry type which will be used for manually
entered entries.
.PP
.BR [TUI]
.TP
.IR default_list_args = \-l
This field specifies the default arguments to use for the list view.
.TP
.IR prompt_before_quit = True
This field specifies whether the user is prompted to verify the final quit
operation.
.TP
.IR reverse_order = True
This field specifies whether the database is listed in reverse order by default.
This is useful because in this way the latest added entries will be at the top.
.TP
.IR scroll_offset = 3
This field specifies the scrolling offset used to prevent the cursor line to coming too close to the
ends of the screen while scrolling.
The intent of this setting is to provide a similar behavior as the 'scrolloff' option available in
Vim.
