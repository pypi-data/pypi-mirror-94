        QtPyVCP is a Qt and Python based framework for building virtual control panels
        for the LinuxCNC machine control.
        
        The goal is to provide a no-code, drag-and-drop system for making simple VCPs,
        as well as a straightforward, flexible and extensible framework to aid in
        building complex VCPs.
        
        
        ## Installation and Usage
        
        See the [documentation](https://kcjengr.github.io/qtpyvcp/).

        ## Dependancies
        
        * LinuxCNC 2.8^ or master
        * Python 2.7
        * PyQt5 or PySide2
        
        QtPyVCP is developed and tested using the LinuxCNC Debian 9 and 10 x64 (stretch and buster)
        [Live ISO](http://linuxcnc.org/downloads/). It should run
        on any system that can have PyQt5 installed, but Debian 9 and 10 x64 is the only OS
        that is officially supported.
