; === Features of the law configuration parser =====================================================

; --- The law home directory -----------------------------------------------------------------------
; The law home directory is the default location of a small number of files and directories that are
; created when working with law. Please refer to the particular configuration options below for more
; information. The law home directory defaults to "$LAW_HOME" or "$HOME/.law".

; --- Configuration file resolution order ----------------------------------------------------------
; Law configuration files (like the one you are just reading) are looked up in a certain order:
; $LAW_CONFIG_FILE, ./law.cfg, "config" in the law home directory, or "etc/law/config". The config
; parser only reads the first existing file.

; --- Inheritance and extensions -------------------------------------------------------------------
; The law configuration can inherit from or can be extended by additional configuration files. See
; the options "inherit_configs" and "extend_configs" in the "[core]" section of the law
; configuration below. The only difference between the two is that options defined in
; "inherit_configs" do not overwrite those in the actual config, whereas options of "extend_configs"
; do.

; --- Option referencing ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; To avoid that some configurations are copied to other options (which is required in some cases),
; the law configuration parser supports references. The syntax for references to options in the same
; section is "&::other_option", and "&::other_section::other_option" for options in other sections.
; None is returned in case a reference cannot be resolved. The same applies to circular references.

; --- Environment variable expansion ---------------------------------------------------------------
; Configuration values that contain environment variables are automatically expanded by most getters
; of the law configuration parser, such as "get_expanded", "get_expanded_int", etc.

; --- The "None" value -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Getters of the law configuration parser such as "get_default", get_expanded", "get_expanded_int",
; etc., are configured to return a default value (which itself defaults to "None" (the NoneType)) in
; case an option is not existing. Sometimes it can be useful to actively declare an option as
; missing. This can be achieved by setting an option to "None" (string).

; --- Synchronization with luigi configuration -----------------------------------------------------
; law is built on top of luigi and does not replace it. Therefore, another luigi-specfic
; configuration file is actually required. However, law provides a mechanism to define the luigi
; configuration right within the law configuration file. All sections starting with "luigi" plus
; underscore, e.g. "[luigi_worker]" are forwarded to luigi. Environment variable expansion is
; performed as well. This behavior is configurable by the "sync_luigi_config" option in the "[core]"
; section.

; --- bash_sandbox_env section ---------------------------------------------------------------------

[bash_sandbox_env]

; Note:
; Here you can define environment variables via key-value pairs that are accessible in a bash
; sandbox. When an option has no value, i.e., when only a key is given, the value of the variable of
; the current environment is used.
; The environment variables defined in this section are applied to all bash sandboxes. To configure
; variables per bash initialization file, create a section "bash_sandbox_env_<init_file>" with the
; desired values.


; --- docker_sandbox section -----------------------------------------------------------------------

[docker_sandbox]

; Note:
; This section defines the default options for all docker sandboxes. To configure options per image,
; create a section "docker_sandbox_<image_name>" with the desired options.


; stagein_dir_name
; Description: Name of a directory which is placed automatically inside a temporary directory and to
; which input files are staged-in outside of the sandbox and provided to the sandboxed task. When

; within the sandbox.
; Type: string
; Default: "stagein"

; stageout_dir_name
; Description: Name of a directory which is placed automatically inside a temporary directory and
; provided to sandboxed tasks to store outputs and from which those files are staged-out outside the
; sandbox. When "None", no stage-out is performed and the task is assumed to be able to store
; outputs directly from within the sandbox.
; Type: string
; Default: "stageout"

; uid
; Description: The user id of the account inside the docker container. When "None", the container is
; started with its default value.

; --- docker_sandbox_volumes section ---------------------------------------------------------------

[docker_sandbox_volumes]

; Note:
; Here you can define volumes that are mounted in docker containers via key-value pairs that
; represent host and container directory, respectively.

; image, create a section "docker_sandbox_volumes_<image_name>" with the desired values.


; --- singularity_sandbox section ------------------------------------------------------------------
