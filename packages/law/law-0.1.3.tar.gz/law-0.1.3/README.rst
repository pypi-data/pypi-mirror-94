**Note**: This project is currently under development. Version 1.0.0 will be the first, fully documented beta release, targetted for early 2021.

Use law to build complex and large-scale task workflows. It is build on top of `luigi <https://github.com/spotify/luigi>`__ and adds abstractions for **run locations**, **storage locations** and **software environments**. Law strictly disentangles these building blocks and ensures they remain interchangeable and resource-opportunistic.

Key features:

- CLI with auto-completion and interactive status and dependency inspection.
- Remote targets with automatic retries and local caching
   - WebDAV, HTTP, Dropbox, SFTP, all WLCG protocols (srm, xrootd, rfio, dcap, gsiftp, ...)
- Automatic submission to batch systems from within tasks
   - HTCondor, LSF, gLite, ARC
- Environment sandboxing, configurable on task level
   - Docker, Singularity, Sub-Shells

First steps
===========

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

Install via `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/law>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install law

This command also installs `luigi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/luigi>`__ and `six <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`__.

Remote targets also require `gfal2 <http://dmc.web.cern.ch/projects/gfal-2/home>`__ and `gfal2-python <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gfal2-python>`__ (optional, also via pip) to be installed.


Docker Images
-------------

To run and test law, there are three docker images available on the `DockerHub <https://cloud.docker.com/u/riga/repository/docker/riga/law>`__, corresponding to Python versions 2.7, 3.7 and 3.8. They are based on CentOS 7 and ship with the dependencies listed above, including gfal2.

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -ti riga/law:latest


Tags:

- ``latest``, ``py3``, ``py38``: Latest Python 3.8
- ``py37``: Latest Python 3.7
- ``py2``, ``py27``: Python 2.7.5
- ``example``: Example runner, based on ``latest`` (see `below <#examples>`__)

Auto completion on the command-line
===================================

bash
----

.. code-block:: shell

   source "$( law completion )"


zsh
---

zsh is able to load and evaluate bash completion scripts via ``bashcompinit``. In order for ``bashcompinit`` to work, you should run ``compinstall`` to enable completion scripts:

.. code-block:: shell

   autoload -Uz compinstall && compinstall

After following the instructions, these lines should be present in your ~/.zshrc:

.. code-block:: shell

   # The following lines were added by compinstall
   zstyle :compinstall filename '~/.zshrc'

   autoload -Uz compinit
   compinit
   # End of lines added by compinstall

If this is the case, just source the law completion script (which internally enables ``bashcompinit``) and you're good to go:

.. code-block:: shell

   source "$( law completion )"
