Description: 
        # Py-PDM
        
        A Python wrapper of the Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM), which is a [C code written by Stellingwerf](https://www.stellingwerf.com/rfs-bin/index.cgi?action=PageView&id=34).
        
        Compared with other Python implementations, with the help of Cython, we can obtain a much faster PDM tool.
        
        # Installation
        To install Py-PDM with pip:
        
        ```
        pip install py-pdm
        ```
        
        Alternatively you can install it manually:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/ckm3/Py-PDM.git
        cd Py-PDM
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        # Usage
        ```python3
        from pdmpy import pdm
        
        freq, theta = pdm(time, y_value, y_sigma, frequency_min, frequency_max, frequency_step, number_of_bins)
        ```
        Please refer to the example directory to see in details.
