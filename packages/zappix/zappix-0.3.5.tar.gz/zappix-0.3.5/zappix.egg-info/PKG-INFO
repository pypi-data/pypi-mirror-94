Description: # zappix - a package for Zabbix sender and get.
        
        zappix aims to be a drop-in replacement for zabbix_get as well as zabbix_sender.
        Its components are available not only as a module but from the command line as well.
        
        zappix requires Python3 and is guaranteed to work with 3.6.
        
        ## Instalation 
        
        zappix is not dependant on any third party modules.
        The easiest way to install it with pip:
        ```sh
        pip install zappix
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        As mentioned earlier - zappix can be used both as a module inside of an application, as well as from the Command Line Interface.
        
        ## As a module
        
        At the moment zappix has two classes: Sender and Get. Both of which can be imported in the following manner:
        ```python
        >>> from zappix.sender import Sender
        >>> from zappix.get import Get
        ```
        
        Then you can send or get some data. Asuming both Zabbix Agent and Server run on localhost and default ports:
        
        ```python
        >>> getter = Get("127.0.0.1")
        >>> getter.get_value("agent.ping")
        1
        >>> sender = Sender("127.0.0.1")
        >>> sender.send_value('testhost', 'test', 1)
        {"processed": 1, "failed": 0, "total": 1, "seconds spent": 0.005}
        
        ```
        
        ## CLI
        
        To use this utility from the command line, you need to invoke python with the -m flag, followed by the module name and required parameters:
        
        ```sh
        python -m zappix.sender -z 127.0.0.1 -s testhost -k testkey -o 1
        ```
