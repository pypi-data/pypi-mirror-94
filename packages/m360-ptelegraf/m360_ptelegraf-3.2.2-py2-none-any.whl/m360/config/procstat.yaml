      ## PID file to monitor process
      ## pid_file: /var/run/crond.pid
      ## executable name (ie, pgrep <exe>)
      #exe: java
      ## pattern as argument for pgrep (ie, pgrep -f <pattern>)
      pattern: =2 \-Dsun\.io\.useCanonPrefixCache=false
      ## user as argument for pgrep (ie, pgrep -u <user>)

      ## Systemd unit name
      # systemd_unit: nginx.service
      ## CGroup name or path
      # cgroup: "systemd/system.slice/nginx.service"

      ## Windows service name
      # win_service: ""

      ## override for process_name
      ## This is optional; default is sourced from /proc/<pid>/status
      # process_name: "bar"

      ## Field name prefix
      # prefix: ""

      ## When true add the full cmdline as a tag.
      # cmdline_tag: false

      ## Mode to use when calculating CPU usage. Can be one of 'solaris' or 'irix'.
      # mode: "irix"

      ## Add the PID as a tag instead of as a field.  When collecting multiple
      ## processes with otherwise matching tags this setting should be enabled to
      ## ensure each process has a unique identity.
      ##
      ## Enabling this option may result in a large number of series, especially
      ## when processes have a short lifetime.
      # pid_tag: false

      ## Method to use when finding process IDs.  Can be one of 'ps','pgrep', or
      ## 'native'.  The pgrep finder calls the pgrep executable in the PATH while
      ## the native finder performs the search directly in a manor dependent on the
      ## platform.  Default is 'ps'
      # pid_finder: ["ps","-e","-o","user,group,pid,args"]
