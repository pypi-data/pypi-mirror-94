**examplecurves** is a module outsourced from 
[arithmeticmeancurves](https://gitlab.com/david.scheliga/arithmeticmeancurve).
Its main purpose is to provide exemplary families of curves for testing and 
debugging purposes.

## Installation

```` shell script
    $ pip install examplecurves
````

If available the latest development state can be installed from gitlab.

```` shell script
    $ pip install git+https://gitlab.com/david.scheliga/examplecurves.git@dev
````

## Alpha Development Status

The current development state of this project is *alpha*. Towards the beta

- naming of modules, classes and methods will change, since the final wording is not
  done.
- Code inspections are not finished.
- The documentation is broad or incomplete.
- Testing is not complete, as it is added during the first test phase. At this
  state mostly doctests are applied at class or function level.


## Basic Usage

# Changelog
This changelog is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.0.0rc1] - 2021-02-13
### Added
- .coveragerc, .travis.yml, makefile, tox.ini, tests/load_test.py, tests/plot_test.py

### Changed
- CreatesCurves inherits from abc.ABC
- setup.py to setup.cfg

### Removed
- Functions create, load

## [0.5a0.post1] - 2021-01-08
### Fixed
- Missing requirements for installation via pip.

## [0.5a0] - 2021-01-02
### Added
- New families of curves *VerticalLinear0*, *VerticalLinear1*, *VerticalLinear2* and
  *VerticalLinear3*.

## [0.4a0] - 2020-12-27
### Added
- New families of curves *DiagonalLinear0*, *DiagonalLinear1*, *DiagonalLinear2* and
  *DiagonalLinear3*.

### Changed
- The necessity of sub classes of static linear families of curves was removed, changing
  the creation and documentation layout. In this case all subclasses were removed, since
  they wasn't meant to be used directly anyway.

## [0.3a0] - 2020-12-17
### Added
- New families of curves *HorizontalLinear1*, *HorizontalLinear2* and
 *HorizontalLinear3*.

## [0.2a1] - 2020-12-17
### Fixed
- Missing parameter leading to broken installation.
- Missing requirement 'dicthandling'

## [0.2a0] - 2020-12-15
### Added
- A normal distributed linear family of curves with *LinearHorizontal0*.
- Support for loading curve creation parameters from json files.
- *resources* subpackage for parameter files.

### Changed
- Turned module `examplecurves.py` into a `examplecurves` package.
- Shifted project to *setuptools_scm*; updated setup.py

### Removed
- Constant \_\_version\_\_ is removed; package version is now managed solely by git
  tags.

## [0.1a0] - 2020-12-05
### Changed
- added class `Static` to distinguish static curves from random curves, which
  are on the way.

### deprecated
- Method `create` will be moved to `Static` in the next release.

## [0.0a1] - 2020-12-05
- First code release of examplecurves
