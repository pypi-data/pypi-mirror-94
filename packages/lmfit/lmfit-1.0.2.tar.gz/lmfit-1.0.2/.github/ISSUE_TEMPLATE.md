### DO NOT IGNORE ###

READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS FULLY. IF YOU DO NOT, YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED.

If you have not submitted a GitHub Issue to lmfit before, read
[this](https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

***DO NOT USE GitHub Issues for questions, it is only for bugs!***

If you **think** something is an Issue, it probably is not an Issue.
Getting a "bad fit" does NOT qualify as an Issue! Issues here are
concerned with errors or problems in the lmfit code.

Use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/lmfit-py) for
questions about lmfit or things you think might be problems. If you ignore
this advice and post a question as a GitHub Issue anyway, your Issue will
be closed and not answered. If you have any doubt, start with the mailing
list.

To submit an Issue, you MUST provide ALL of the following information. If
you delete any of these sections, your Issue may be closed. If you think one
of the sections does not apply to your Issue, state that explicitly.

#### First Time Issue Code
<!-- If this is your first Issue, you will write down the Secret Code for First Time Issues from the CONTRIBUTING.md file linked to above -->

#### Description
<!-- Provide a short description of the issue, describe the expected outcome, and give the actual result -->

###### A Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example
<!-- see, for example, https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve on how to do this. -->

###### Error message:
<!-- If any, paste the *full* error message inside a code block (starting from line Traceback) -->

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ...
```

###### Version information
<!-- Generate version information with this command in the Python shell and copy the output here:
import sys, lmfit, numpy, scipy, asteval, uncertainties
print('Python: {}\n\nlmfit: {}, scipy: {}, numpy: {}, asteval: {}, uncertainties: {}'\
      .format(sys.version, lmfit.__version__, scipy.__version__, numpy.__version__, \
      asteval.__version__, uncertainties.__version__))
 -->

###### Link(s)
