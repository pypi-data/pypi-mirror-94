features:
  - The ``openstack overcloud deploy`` and ``openstack overcloud plan
    create`` commands now have a ``--disable-password-generation``
    argument, to allow operators to disable password generation and
    only use passwords provided by them instead. By default, password
    generation remains enabled.
