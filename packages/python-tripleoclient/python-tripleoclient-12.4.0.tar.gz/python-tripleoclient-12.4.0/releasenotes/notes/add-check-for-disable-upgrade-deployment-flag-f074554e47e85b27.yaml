upgrade:
  - If the operator specifies a roles_data.yaml for the deployment or upgrade
    this adds a check that the disable_upgrade_deployment flag is set at least
    once in that file and otherwise logs a warning. If the
    validation-warnings-fatal parameter is set to True (default is False) then
    this check will also raise an InvalidConfiguration exception.
