    A new command, "openstack overcloud credentials" has been added to create
    the overcloudrc and overcloudrc.v3 files for your deployment. This is
    particularly useful if the deploy is started from the GUI.
issues:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the permissions of the overcloudrc.v3 file. The chmod
    call was not being used on it correctly.
