upgrade:
  - |
    Upgrades and updates are now use tripleo-admin user to connect to
    the overcloud by default, which makes it work the same in this
    regard as fresh deployment.
deprecations:
  - |
    The `--ssh-user` parameter for `overcloud upgrade run` command and
    similar commands is now deprecated and will be removed. In the
    future, `tripleo-admin` user will be used always, which will make
    it work the same as deployment workflow.
