upgrade:
  - The --use-heat option from undercloud install has been removed along with
    the ability to deploy an undercloud on baremetal using instack-undercloud
    via 'openstack undercloud install'. Manual deployment may still be possible
    by directly invoking the instack-undercloud scripts but it is no longer
    available via the 'openstack undercloud install' command.
