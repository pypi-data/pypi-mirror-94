    Add --work-dir to openstack overcloud container image build command and
    every run will create a unique workspace which where will be stored Kolla
    configs and build logs. Default directory will be in
    /tmp/container-builds. UUIDs are used to identify each time we run the
    command and will be the directory name in the work dir.
