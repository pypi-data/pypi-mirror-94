    This changes the upgrade workflow for the standalone and undercloud
    where we now run the post_upgrade_tasks after the deployment.
    So the order is upgrade_tasks, deployment steps (docker/puppet),
    then post_upgrade_tasks which is the same order as the overcloud.
    It will allow us to execute some specific post upgrade tasks on standalone
    and undercloud, like removing Docker containers when upgrading to Podman.
