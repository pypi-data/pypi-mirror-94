    The new command `openstack tripleo container image prepare` will do the
    same container image preperation which happens during undercloud and
    overcloud deploy, but in a standalone command. The prepare operations are
    driven by a heat environment file containing the parameter
    `ContainerImagePrepare`. This parameter allows multiple upload and
    modification operations to be specified, and the result will be a list of
    image parameters to use during a tripleo deployment.

    The command `openstack tripleo container image prepare default` will
    generate a `ContainerImagePrepare` with the recommended defaults to use for
    `openstack tripleo container image prepare`.
