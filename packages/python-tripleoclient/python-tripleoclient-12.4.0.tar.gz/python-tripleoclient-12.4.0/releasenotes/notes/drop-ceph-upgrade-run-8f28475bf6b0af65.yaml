    The `openstack overcloud ceph-upgrade run` command no longer works
    in Rocky due to internal changes to TripleO (more direct execution
    of Ansible). The command has been removed from the CLI. Ceph
    update/upgrade in Rocky is meant to be performed via `openstack
    overcloud external-update run` and `openstack overcloud
    external-upgrade run` commands, respectively.
