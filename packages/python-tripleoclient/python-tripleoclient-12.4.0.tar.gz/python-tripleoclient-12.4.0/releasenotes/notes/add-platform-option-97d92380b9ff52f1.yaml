    In certain situations it may be desirable to provide optimised overcloud
    images for deployed nodes.  In order to achieve this add a ``--platform``
    option to ``openstack overcloud image upload``.  This option will then be
    used to select appropriate images based on the combination of architecture
    and platform.
