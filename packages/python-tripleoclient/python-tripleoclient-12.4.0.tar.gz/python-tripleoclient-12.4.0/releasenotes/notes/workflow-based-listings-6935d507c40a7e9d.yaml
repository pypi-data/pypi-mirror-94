features:
  - |
    New ``openstack overcloud roles`` ``list`` and ``show`` commands
    were added in order to look at the roles as they are defined in the
    plan in the Swift container.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``openstack overcloud role list`` and ``openstack overcloud role
    show`` are deprecated in favour of ``openstack overcloud roles
    list`` and ``openstack overcloud roles show`` respectively. The new
    commands operate directly on the plan rather than on the local
    filesystem.
