    The operator is now able to pass extra variables while executing validations
    through the command line. The command line will accept either a Dict with
    the new --extra-vars argument or the absolute path of a file (JSON or YAML
    when using ansible and JSON only when using Mistral) with the new
    --extra-vars-file argument.
