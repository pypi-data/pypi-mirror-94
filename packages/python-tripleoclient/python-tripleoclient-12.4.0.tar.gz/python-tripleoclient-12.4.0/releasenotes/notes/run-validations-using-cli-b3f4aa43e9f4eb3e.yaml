    Running and listing the validations was only possible by executing 
    the Mistral workflow associated with those tasks.
    Now we have the possibility of running and listing the validations
    using the TripleO CLI.
    The commands added are 'openstack tripleo validator run' and
    'openstack tripleo validator list' with its corresponding parameters.
