upgrade:
  - |
    This adds the new --roles and --nodes parameters for the Queens major
    upgrade cli, specifically for the 'openstack overcloud upgrade run' which
    executes the ansible playbooks on overcloud nodes.

        openstack overcloud upgrade run --nodes compute-0 compute-1
        openstack overcloud upgrade run --roles Controller

    Nodes for controlplane roles (the default 'Controller' role for example)
    need to be upgraded using the --roles parameter as these nodes must be
    upgraded together/in parallel.

    For non controlplane roles the --nodes parameter can be used to limit the
    upgrade run to one or more nodes as specified by the operator.
