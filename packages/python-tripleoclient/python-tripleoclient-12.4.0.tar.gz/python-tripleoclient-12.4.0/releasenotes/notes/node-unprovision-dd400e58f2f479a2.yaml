    New command "openstack overcloud node unprovision"

    This is a companion command to "openstack overcloud node provision"
    which is required for scale-down and should be run after "openstack
    overcloud deploy".

    It will undeploy any instance which has provisioned=False in the
    supplied roles yaml.
