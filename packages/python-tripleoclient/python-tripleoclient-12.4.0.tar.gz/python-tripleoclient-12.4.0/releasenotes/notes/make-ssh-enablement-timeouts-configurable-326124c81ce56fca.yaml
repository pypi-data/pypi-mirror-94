features:
  - |
    Added `--overcloud-ssh-enable-timeout` to allow end users to increase the
    wait time during the deploy, ffu, upgrade and admin actions. By default
    this is 600 seconds.
  - |
    Added `--overcloud-ssh-port-timeout` to allow end users to increase the
    time we wait for ssh to become ready on the hosts during the deploy, ffu,
    upgrade and admin actions. On older hardware or slow booting hardware, the
    300 seconds we wait by default for the port to come up may not be sufficient.
