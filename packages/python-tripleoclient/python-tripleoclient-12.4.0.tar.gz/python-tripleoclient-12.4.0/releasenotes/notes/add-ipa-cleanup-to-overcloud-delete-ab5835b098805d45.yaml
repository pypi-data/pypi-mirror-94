    The `overcloud delete` subcommand now supports cleaning up overcloud hosts,
    services, and DNS entries in FreeIPA. This is applicable to deployments
    with TLS support enabled since FreeIPA serves DNS and manages certificates
    for overcloud infrastructure. This subcommand also includes a new option
    called ``--skip-ipa-cleanup`` that allows the caller to forego cleaning up
    FreeIPA. This may be useful when deployers want to forcibly cleanup
    overcloud stacks and leave FreeIPA entries intact (e.g., network partition
    events where the FreeIPA server isn't reachable). Note that you will need
    to manually cleanup FreeIPA if you use ``--skip-ipa-cleanup``.
