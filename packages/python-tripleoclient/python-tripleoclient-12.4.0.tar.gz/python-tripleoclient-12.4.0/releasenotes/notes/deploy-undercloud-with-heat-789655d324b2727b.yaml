    EXPERIMENTAL feature to install the undercloud with openstack heat
    add support for a containerized undercloud. It checks for prequisites
    and installs missing packages then deploys undercloud with heat-all.

    New flag `--install-kolla`, defaults to False. Adds or removes Kolla
    packages to/from the list of required packages to be installed by the
    ``openstack undercloud deploy`` command. Set it to True, if you want
    to build Kolla containers on the undercloud node as the part of your
    continuous deployment pipeline.
