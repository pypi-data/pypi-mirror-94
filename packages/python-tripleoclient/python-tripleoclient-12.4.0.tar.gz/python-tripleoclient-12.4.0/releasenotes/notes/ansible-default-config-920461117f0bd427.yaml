    ``tripleo config generate ansible`` generates the default ``ansible.cfg``
    in the given ``--output-dir`` (defaults to `$HOME`). The remote user
    setting for ansible will be set to the ``--deployment-user`` value
    (defaults to 'stack').

    .. note:: Do not confuse the generated config with ``~/.ansible.cfg``.
       The latter takes the lower precedence.

    You may want to customize the generated config so it will be used
    with all undercloud and standalone deployments.

    .. note:: Overcloud deployments use Mistral workflows to configure ansible
       for its own use, but the basic configuration it takes looks very
       similar.
