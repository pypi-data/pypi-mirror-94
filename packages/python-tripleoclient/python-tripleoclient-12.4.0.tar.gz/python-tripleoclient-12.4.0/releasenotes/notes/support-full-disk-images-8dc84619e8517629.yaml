features:
  - Allow client to support whole disk images. Client
    will now accept a --whole-disk flag on the
    overcloud image upload command. When this flag is
    set, it will only look for qcow2 image, not enforcing
    the upload of initrd and vmlinuz images. It will also
    not set these properties on the qcow2 image on glance.
    This will allow Ironic to consider the uploaded image
    as full disk image, giving the possibility to provide
    full disk images in TripleO instead of single partition
    ones.
    Please look at `Ironic documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/baremetal/draft/configure-integration.html#create-and-add-images-to-the-image-service>`_
