    Instack undercloud legacy passwords should be customized by its original
    ``undercloud-passwords.conf`` location, when upgrading from instack UC.
    Those passwords will be automatically transitioned to
    ``tripleo-undercloud-passwords.yaml`` during upgrade. Changes made to the
    legacy location become ignored after that. Use
    ``tripleo-undercloud-passwords.yaml`` to manually update UC passwords
    further on.
