    6.0.0 is the final release for Ocata.
    It's the first release where release notes are added.
features:
  - Use the overcloudrc generated in a Mistral action so both
    CLI and UI can use the same file when interacting with the
    deployed OpenStack.
  - Default image build to use yaml files.
    If no args are given to the overcloud image build, it will
    default to using the CentOS yaml files in
    /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-common/image-yaml.
  - Simplify fetching the passwords from Mistral.
  - Add --disable-validations argument that will disable the run
    of validations completely. This feature is useful when we deploy
    TripleO with multinode and deployed-server features.
fixes:
  - Fixes `bug 1649588
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1649588>`__ so exceptions are not
    swallowed anymore which was leading to 0 exit code.
    Now, it returns a proper exit code when plan deletion fails.
  - Add new hiera agent hook to legacy image build.
    The change Ia1864933235152b7e899c4442534879f8e22240d added these to the
    newer overcloud-images.yaml method of building images.  Unfortunately
    because the old 'openstack overcloud image build --all' method does not
    leverage this file yet, it leads to a timeout in deployment because the
    heat agents are not available.
    It fixes `bug 1651616
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1651616>`__.
  - Fixes `bug 1637474
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1637474>`__ so we manage
    --initial-state flag for register_or_update.
  - Fixes `bug 1648861
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1648861>`__ so that if the plan
    creation fails, the Swift container isn't created.
other:
  - Remove the keystone_pki cert generation, which is not needed anymore.
