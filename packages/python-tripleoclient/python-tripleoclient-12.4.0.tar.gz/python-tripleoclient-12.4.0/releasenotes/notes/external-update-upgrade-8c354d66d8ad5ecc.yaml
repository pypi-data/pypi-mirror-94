    New `openstack overcloud external-update run` and `openstack
    overcloud external-upgrade run` commands are defined. These are
    meant to perform updates and upgrades for services deployed via
    external_deploy_tasks. A separate command is used because external
    installers don't fit well within the --nodes and --roles selection
    pattern we've established for the normal `update run` and `upgrade
    run` commands.
