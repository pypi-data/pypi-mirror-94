    Undercloud and tripleo standalone deployments support logging
    into a log file. In ``undercloud.conf`` the log file path may be
    defined via `undercloud_log_file`. For the standalone
    deployments, use the ``--log-file`` commmand line argument.

    By default, undercloud pre-flight/installation/upgrade logs
    will be written into ``install-undercloud.log`` in the current dir
    (wherefrom the client command is executed).
