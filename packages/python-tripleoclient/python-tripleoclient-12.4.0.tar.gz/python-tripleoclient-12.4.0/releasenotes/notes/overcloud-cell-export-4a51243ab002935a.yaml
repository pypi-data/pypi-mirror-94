    [1] provides the steps on how to setup multiple cells using tripleo.
    This requires to extract deployment information from the overcloud
    /control plane stack which then is used as input for the cell deployment.

    With this patch we provide a new tripleoclient functionality which helps
    to automate the export steps from [1]:
    * Export the default cell EndpointMap
    * Export the default cell HostsEntry
    * Export AllNodesConfig and GlobalConfig information
    * Export passwords
