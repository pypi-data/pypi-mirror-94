deprecations:

    Renamed some options to the `openstack overcloud container image prepare`
    command for clarity.  The '--images-file' option was renamed to
    '--output-images-file'.  The '--env-file' option was renamed to
    '--output-env-file'.  The '--service-environment-file' option was renamed
    to '--environment-file'. The old options are still in place and show
    a deprecation warning in the help message.
