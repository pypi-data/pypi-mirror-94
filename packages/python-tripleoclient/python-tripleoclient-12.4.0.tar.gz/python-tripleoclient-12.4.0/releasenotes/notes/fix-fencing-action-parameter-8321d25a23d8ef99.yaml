    The `overcloud generate fencing` command no longer carries a default value
    for the `action` parameter. Advice from upstream Pacemaker is that this
    value should no longer be passed to fencing agents as it may cause
    inconsistent behaviour. The parameter remains, but is now optional, and
    its use is discouraged.
