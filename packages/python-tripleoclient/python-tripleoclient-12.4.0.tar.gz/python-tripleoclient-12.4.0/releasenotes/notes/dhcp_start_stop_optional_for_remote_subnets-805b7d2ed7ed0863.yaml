    The ``dhcp_start`` and ``dhcp_end`` options are now optional for subnet
    definitions in the Undercloud configuration (``undercloud.conf``).
    The the allocation_pools are calculated by removing the ``local_ip``,
    ``gateway``, ``undercloud_admin_host``, ``undercloud_public_host`` and
    ``inspection_iprange`` from the subnets full IP range. Allocation pools for
    all remaining ranges will be configured. Additionally the new option
    ``dhcp_exlcude`` can be used to exclude additional IP addresses and/or
    IP address ranges, for example to exclude ``172.20.0.105`` and the range
    ``172.20.0.210-172.20.0.219``::

      dhcp_exclude = 172.20.0.105,172.20.0.210-172.20.0.219

    * When ``dhcp_start`` is defined any addresses prior to this address is
      also removed from the allocation pools.
    * When ``dhcp_end`` is defined any addresses after this address is also
      removed from the allocation pools.

    .. Note:: If the default cidr (``192.168.24.0/24``) is used for the local
              subnet the ``dhcp_start`` and ``dhcp_end`` cannot simply be
              removed to utilize the full address space of the subnet. This due
              to the default values of ``dhcp_start`` and ``dhcp_end``.

    It is now possible to configure non-contiguous allocation pools for the
    Undercloud ctlplane subnets. The ``dhcp_start`` and ``dhcp_end`` options
    have been extended to allow a list of start and end address pairs. For
    example to create allocation pools ``172.20.0.100-172.20.0.150`` and
    ``172.20.0.200-172.20.0.250``::

      dhcp_start = 172.20.0.100,172.20.0.200
      dhcp_end = 172.20.0.150,172.20.0.250
