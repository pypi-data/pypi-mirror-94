upgrade:
  - |
    This adds a --skip-tags parameter to the openstack overcloud upgrade run
    command

    .. code-block:: bash

        openstack overcloud upgrade run --nodes compute-0 --skip-tags validation

    This is useful for skipping those step 0 tasks (tagged "validation") that
    check if services are running before allowing the upgrade to proceed, especially
    if you must re-run the upgrade after a failed attempt and some services
    cannot easily be started. The currently supported values for this are
    validation and pre-upgrade, and they can be combined as "--skip-tags
    'validation,pre-upgrade'" if required.
