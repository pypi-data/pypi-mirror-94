    --use-heat parameter is deprecated in Rocky cycle and will be removed in
    the future.
    When --use-heat / --use-heat=True is set, the undercloud will be
    containerized and a warning will be shown for the deprecation.
    When --use-heat=False is set, the undercloud won't be containerized.
