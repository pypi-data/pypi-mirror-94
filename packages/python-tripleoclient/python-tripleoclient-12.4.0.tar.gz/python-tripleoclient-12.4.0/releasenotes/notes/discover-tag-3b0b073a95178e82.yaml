  - The "openstack overcloud container image tag discover" command is provided
    to discover the version-based tag by inspecting the image from a stable tag
    like 'current-tripleo-rdo'. Stable tags like 'latest' or 'pike' can't be used
    for container updates because something needs to change to trigger the new
    containers being pulled. Without this command it would be up to the user to
    find out what versioned tag to specify when calling prepare.
