    The validations can now be performed by calling Mistral or by calling
    ``ansible-playbook``. By default, the latter is used. The new ``--use-mistral``
    option allows to execute either groups or a set of specific validations by
    calling Mistral instead of using the default mechanism, ie. ``ansible-playbook``.
