    The `--ceph-ansible-playbook` parameter has been removed from all
    update- and upgrade-related commands. The parameter is not
    necessary anymore, as the right playbook should be selected
    automatically (but for cases when control is needed, overriding
    CephAnsiblePlaybook parameter via environment file will still take
    priority). Furthermore, the `--ceph-ansible-playbook` CLI
    parameter was attempting to override the detection logic which
    selects desired ceph-ansible playbook.
