# Usage:
# - PRs should drop a file like "issuenumber.feature" in newsfragments
#   (or "bugfix", "doc", "removal", "misc"; misc gets no text, we can
#    customize this)
# - At release time after bumping version number, run: towncrier
#   (or towncrier --draft)
# - Make sure to use a version with the PRs mentioned below merged.
#   You probably want https://github.com/hawkowl/towncrier/pull/69 too.
#   Right now on my laptop it's
#     PYTHONPATH=~/src/towncrier/src ~/src/towncrier/bin/towncrier
#   with the merge-64-66-69 branch checked out.
