Introduction
------------
Cursor objects are return by the Client.sql() API.
A cursor simply binds the query to a particular collection and the
query is not executed server side until the application starts to fetch
results from the cursor.

.. note:: Cursors are never instantiated directly by the application \
and are always instantiated by Rockset Client ``sql()`` APIs.

Fetch all results
-----------------

Use the cursor's results() method to fetch all the results of the query
in one shot::

    results = mycollection.sql(q).results()

The above technique will work well, if the number of results returned by the
query is limited, say because it employs a LIMIT clause.

For queries, that return a large number of results, please use the cursor
iterators as described below.

Iterators with automatic pagination
-----------------------------------

Cursor objects are iterables, so you can do something like::

    results = mycollection.sql(q)
    for r in results:
        print(r)

Cursor objects support seamless automatic pagination to iterate over large
result sets. The cursor iterator will fetch and buffer a small portion of the
results and as the iterator reaches the end of the current batch of buffered
results, it will automatically issue the query with the appropriate pagination
parameters to buffer the next batch and seamlessly continue results iteration.

The default cursor iterator uses a batch size of 10,000. You can create a cursor
iterator with a different batch size by using the ``iter()`` method.

Example using the default cursor iterator::

    results = mycollection.sql(q)
    for r in results:
        print(r)


Example using a custom cursor iterator with batch size 200::

    results = mycollection.sql(q)
    for r in results.iter(200):
        print(r)

.. automethod:: rockset.Cursor.iter()

Async requests
--------------

Cursors support asyncio.Future to schedule and run queries concurrently
along with other async events in your application.

One can create an asyncio.Future from a cursor object using the
``Cursor.async_request()`` method. These futures are not scheduled in
any async threads and the application have to schedule them in an asyncio
event loop. Once the futures are scheduled and run to completion, then
the results of their respective queries can be accessed by calling
future.result(). The return value of future.result() will be identical
to calling Cursor.results() API on the original query.

For example::

    jims_future = people.sql(F["first_name"] == "Jim").async_request()
    sfmerch_future = merchants.sql(F["zipcode"] == "94107").async_request()

    # can schedule these asyncio.futures along with other futures
    # issue both queries concurrently and block until both of them finish
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(jims_future, sfmerch_future))

    all_jims = jims_future.result()
    all_sfmerchants = sfmerch_future.result()

Even if an future was originally issued by an async_requst() API call,
one can still call the blocking Cursor.results() API to fetch the results
synchronously. Cursor.results() will schedule the future, block until the
future finishes execution and then will return those results. A subsequent
future.result() call will return the query results immediately.

For example::

    jims_cursor = people.sql(F["first_name"] == "Jim")
    jims_future = jims_cursor.async_request()

    # do a blocking results() will block on the future behind the scenes
    results = jims_cursor.results()

    # this will return immediately without incurring any server round-trip
    results2 = jims_future.result()
