# A tool for generating Sony A7RIII/IV and Fujifilm GFX 100 Pixel-Shift files #

This is a work by Alberto Griggio in <https://github.com/agriggio/make_arq>. The fork here is only packaging it properly and distribute it through PyPI and conda-forge.

## Description

This is a simple command-line script to combine 4 or 16 source raw files taken in Pixel Shift Multi Shooting mode with a Sony A7RIII/IV or a Fujifilm GFX 100 camera and save the result as a pseudo-ARQ file, similarly to what Sony's Imaging Edge would do.
The generated file is a "pseudo-ARQ" in the sense that it will have the same data layout as proper ARQ files generated by Sony's Imaging Edge, but the metadata will be different. As such, the files will not be compatible with Sony's software. They can however be processed by [ART](http://bitbucket.org/agriggio/art) or [RawTherapee](http://rawtherapee.com).

## Install

Use either pip, conda/mamba:

```bash
pip install make_arq
conda install -c conda-forge make_arq
mamba install -c conda-forge make_arq
```

## Dependencies

- Python (tested with 3.8);

- [exiftool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/), which must be in your `PATH`;

- [tifffile](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tifffile)

- [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)

- Optional, [rawpy](https://pypi.org/project/rawpy/) for handling Fujifilm GFX 100 files.


## Example usage

```bash
# for Sony A7RIII
make_arq file1.ARW file2.ARW file3.ARW file4.ARW -o out4.ARQ

# for Sony A7RIV
make_arq file1.ARW ... file16.ARW -o out16.ARQ
# or alternatively, to force 4-frame mode
make_arq file1.ARW ... file16.ARW -4 -o out4.ARQ

# for Fujifilm GFX 100
make_arq file1.RAF ... file16.RAF -o out16.ARQ
make_arq file1.RAF ... file16.RAF -4 -o out4.ARQ
```
