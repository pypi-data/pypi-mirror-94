    vitrage-dashboard now uses non-compressed static files from the 'vendor'
    directory by default. All scripts will be compressed if `COMPRESS_ENABLED`
    option it set to True during `python manage.py compress` command execution.
    Also it removes minified static files what helps maintainerss to create
    RPM/DEP packages for vitrage-dashboard.
