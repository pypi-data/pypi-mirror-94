Description: # databricks-workspace-tool
        
        dwt is a tool to clear run cells from notebooks, for example where there might be concern about data held in run cells, or as preparation for commit to source control.
        
        You can also use it to import/export multiple notebooks with this capability, in use cases where dbc export may not be possible due to volume limits.
