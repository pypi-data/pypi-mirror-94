Description: # Akita Django Integration
        
        This package extends `django.test.Client` in order to instrument Django
        integration tests, capturing requests and responses to the service under test.
        You can drop in `akita_django.test.Client` everywhere you use Django's `Client`,
        and Akita will use your integration tests to build a spec for your service.
        
        Why build specs?  A spec shows your service's APIs.  Using Akita to build specs
        from your integration tests makes it clear what APIs your code implements --
        and you can diff specs, showing what impact a code change will have on your
        customers.  For more info, see [Catching Breaking Changes
        Faster](https://docs.akita.software/docs) in the Akita docs.
        
        ## See it in Action
        
        Take a look at the [Akibox Django
        Tutorial](https://github.com/akitasoftware/akibox-django-rest-framework), which
        implements a toy Dropbox-like file server and tests it using the Akita Django
        Integration.
