prelude: >
    6.0.0 is the final Ocata release for tripleo-image-elements.
    This is also the first release with release notes.
features:
  - Add zaqar.use_websockets option to os-collect-config.
  - Add scripts to zero iptables & ip6tables files at build time.
    When including these new elements, we empty the stock
    /etc/sysconfig/iptables and /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables filse as
    shipped by the iptables rpm package. The reason for this is that
    puppet firewall has a hard time to cope with exiting rules when
    these files are populated and the iptables service is not
    active.
  - Add element to customize dracut on the agent.
    Updates the ironic agent, installing multipath package
    and regenerating dracut to add all the specified drivers.
  - Add element to rebuild dracut enabling modules
    To support TripleO whole disk images (with enabled
    security), we need lvm and crypt modules.
    So creating that element in TripleO, that will install the
    needed packages, and will rebuild the image to add the
    modules we need.
fixes:
  - Purge Chrony package in NTP element.
    If NTP is installed and used, make sure Chrony is not installed because
    they would conflict each others.
  - Fixes `bug 1659493
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1659493>`__ so we don't fail
    on building the IPA ramdisk, by setting
    IRONIC_AGENT_MULTIPATH_DRIVERS to empty when undefined.
other:
  - Copy map-services script to tripleo elements.
    map-services will be removed on dib v2 branch, but
    TripleO still relies heavily on it. To prevent breakage,
    copy the script to the internal element using it.
    In the future, all elements will need to be migrated
    to new svc-map, but it is a massive change.
