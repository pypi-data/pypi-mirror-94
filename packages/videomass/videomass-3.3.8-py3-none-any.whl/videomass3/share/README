When you run the program for the first time, the contents of this folder will
be copied to the user's Videomass configuration directory, according to the
conventions of each operating system which are:

        Linux:       '~/.config/videomass'
        MacOs:       '~/Library/Application Support/videomass'
        Windows:     'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\videomass'

`videomass.conf` is Videomass main configuration file and is used to store
user preferences and to import essential data for the application.

Furthermore, the Videomass configuration directory is also used to load
the presets inside the 'presets/' folder. All presets files have the format
extension `.prst` and contain text with JSON data structure.
