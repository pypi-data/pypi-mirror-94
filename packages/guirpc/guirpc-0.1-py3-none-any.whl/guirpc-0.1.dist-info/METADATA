### RPC core package to build a FaaS-like application service

____
[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/guiloga/guirpc.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/guiloga/guirpc)

| Is a **Python** RPC package to build and run FaaS-like application service.
| It facilitates the creation of an consumer or a producer, as well as an abstraction layer for the transmission
  of messages over a connected message broker server.

It provides an abstraction layer with some decorators, encoders, serializers and in short all the surrounded layers 
for easily build, configure and run an **RPC server** as it makes up as a **FaaS-like application**.

## Built With

* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) - The message broker layer
* [Pika](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) - RabbitMQ client library

## Prerequisites ###

* Python version [**3.6**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) (
  with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/))

## Documentation ###

Package is distributed under [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). Take a look at the
official [documentation](https://guirpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Documentation of this project is created with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html), to build it
run:

```shell script
pip install -U docs/requirements.txt
sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/
```

## Tests

Tests are built with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and run with docker. In order tu run it be sure last
that current stable versions of docker and docker-compose are installed.

- First, build the *foobar* consumer service and run it alongside a RabbitMQ server(optionally with the management
  plugin):

```shell script
docker-compose up --build -d rabbitmq consumer
```

- Run all **unit** and **integration** tests:

```shell script
docker-compose run test
```

Optionally, run code static analysis (with flake8):

```shell script
docker-compose run static_analysis
```

For development, create a link file which associates source code with your interpreter site-packages directory:

```shell script
touch setup.py
echo "import setuptools
setuptools.setup()" > setup.py
# Then do
pip install --editable .
```
