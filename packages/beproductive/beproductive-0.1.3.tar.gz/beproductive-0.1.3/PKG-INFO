Description: # Be Productive
        > A tool that let's you focus on your work by blocking distracting websites. Optionally with a timer for work sessions, using the Pomodoro technique.
        
        
        ## Install
        
        To install **Be Productive**:
        ```pip install beproductive```
        
        If you use Windows, it's recommended to `pip install win10toast` for [nice Windows notifications](https://github.com/jithurjacob/Windows-10-Toast-Notifications).

        You don't have to install `win10toast`, but without it you will not get visible and audible notifications for Pomodoro. However, all notifications are also printed in your command line interface.
        
        ## Blocked Websites
        
        These websites are blocked per default, but you can always edit `blocklist.py` and add your personal time killers.
        
        ```python
        print("\n".join(BLOCKLIST))
        ```

            facebook.com
            instagram.com
            reddit.com
            netflix.com
            amazon.com
            linkedin.com
        
        
        ## How to Use
        
        ### Windows
        You have to open your command line tool with **administrator privileges.**
        
        ### Linux (and MacOS?)
        You have to run Be Productive with **root privileges**, either with `sudo` before every command or once with `su`.
        
        ### Block / Unblock Websites
        Block websites:
        ```
        python -m beproductive
        ```
        Block websites for `x` minutes:
        ```
        python -m beproductive block 45
        ```
        Unblock all websites:
        ```
        python -m beproductive unblock
        ```
        
        Start a Pomodoro session:
        ```
        python -m beproductive pomodoro
        ```
        
        ### Pomodoro
        The [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) feature blocks your defined websites for 25 minutes. It notifies you after the 25 minutes are over and gives you access to all websites for 5 minutes. Although I recommend getting up and stretching instead :) This cycle is repeated 4 times.
        
        You can set custom times. This is how you run 5 Pomodoros of 45 minutes with 10 minute breaks:
        ```
        python -m beproductive pomodoro 45 10 5
        ```
        
        ## Behind the Scenes
        The script blocks URLs by modifying the `hosts` file. Blocked URLs are redirected to `127.0.0.1`. The script backs up the original `hosts` file. You will not lose any customizations and you can always reset to the original state.
        
        ## Roadmap
        - Make customizing the blocklist easy
        - Set up a schedule, i.e., block websites between 9am and 5pm
