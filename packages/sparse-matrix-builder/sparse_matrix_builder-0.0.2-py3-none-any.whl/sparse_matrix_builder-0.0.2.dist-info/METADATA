# Matrix Builder

### What is the Matrix Builder?
The importance of linear algebra and its representation in matrix form has been on a growing
trend for a long time. However, working with the matrix can be a difficult challenge; especially
working with many big matrices in a computer can be a quite tedious task. Therefore, through this project
we have sought to alleviate these burdensome problems with an intuitive solution.
Matrix builder is the GUI program which helps users to build any matrix using an interactive canvas based on 
the **tkinter** library. The program uses a basic drag-and-drop scheme to interact with the users. It supports various
ways to convert users' works in the program into useful formats which users can directly utilize. 


### Builder Layout

### How to use
#### From console



```python
import builder as bd

```

### Helpful Key Bindings
- **Ctrl + v** : Copy and Paste the currently highlighted matrices
- **(Hold) Ctrl** : Enter Multiple Selection Mode. In this mode user can highlight multiple matrices
- **Ctrl + Mousewheel** : Zoom in and out of the canvas. The pivot point of zoom is where the point is
  currently located.
- **Shift + LMB Drag** : Can move the matrix inside the canvas
- **RMB** : Provides useful options depending on a selected entity in the canvas.
