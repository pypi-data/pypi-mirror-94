This project contains some information about busses in Warsaw. You can check out
locations where busses exceed 50km/h in calculate_speed.py module. Also you can track 
the busses and their times on particular bus_stops in check_punctuality.py module.

Modules with 'create' in their names are responsible for creating useful dataframes and saving
them in .csv files. 

bus_coordinates.csv contains busses and their coordinates measured at specific time.

bus_stops.csv contains bus_stops: their names and coordinates. 

coordinates_speed.csv contains coordinates of busses.

speed.csv contains speeds of busses between time periods.
