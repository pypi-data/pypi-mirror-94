    The `Icon` constructor loads an image from the provided path and converts
    the image to square images of varying sizes. The specific sizes were
    retrieved from this Stack Overflow thread (https://stackoverflow.com/
    questions/3236115/which-icon-sizes-should-my-windows-applications-icon-
    include), which describes which icon sizes should be provided to a Windows
    application.

    Attributes:
        images: A list of PIL images scaled to the sizes defined by the
            `sizes` class attribute.
        sizes: A list of integers representing the height and width of each
            image in the `images` list.

    Example:
        >>> from framework.rendering import Window
        >>> icon = Icon("textures/icon.png")
        >>> with Window("Untitled Window", 1080, 720, icon=icon) as window:
