## Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure Cost Management Client Library.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIs
that replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see
[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)
library.

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the
[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).

# Usage

# Release History

## 1.0.0 (2021-02-04)

**Features**

  - Model ExportExecution has a new parameter e_tag

**Breaking changes**

  - Model ExportExecution no longer has parameter tags

## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-09)

This is beta preview version.

This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).

**General breaking changes**

- Credential system has been completly revamped:

  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/
  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`

- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of
  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)
- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead
- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.
- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).
- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:

  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user
  - For a complete set of
  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)


## 0.2.0 (2020-04-08)

**Features**

  - Added operation DimensionsOperations.list
  - Added operation QueryOperations.usage

**Breaking changes**

  - Model QueryDataset no longer has parameter sorting
  - Removed operation DimensionsOperations.list_by_subscription
  - Removed operation QueryOperations.usage_by_scope

**General Breaking Changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
introduce breaking changes. In summary, some modules were incorrectly
visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues
caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the
first place.

  - CostManagementClient cannot be imported from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` anymore (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement` works like before)
  - CostManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.costmanagement`
  - A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported
    anymore using `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models.my_class` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models` works like before)
  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`
    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations.my_class_operations` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations` works like before)

Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.
You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or
use no more than one client per process.
