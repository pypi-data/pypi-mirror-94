# Set data first
Input file: dadi_2pops_CVLN_CVLS_snps.txt
# As we have SNP's file format we need to set the following settings:
Population labels: CVLN, CVLS
Projections: 10, 10  # we downsample AFS for fast example 30, 18 original sizes
Outgroup: False


# Output folder. It should be empty.
Output directory: gadma_result


# Set engine for simulations. We use default moments
Engine: moments
# But we specify grid size for dadi for its usage in generated code
Pts: 30, 40, 50


# Now set structures
Initial structure: 1,1
Final structure: 2,1

# We could specify some additional properties of our model
# We want asymmetric migrations
Symmetric migrations: False
# If True then any population splits into two new in some fraction.
# If False then two new populations after split have its own initial
# sizes. We choose the last option.
Split fractions: False


# No output in stdout
Silence: True

# How many repeats to run and how many processes to use.
Number of repeats: 2
Number of processes: 2
