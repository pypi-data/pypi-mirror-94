# Set data first
Input file: 2pop_e_gillettii_all_snp.fs

# Some additional settings for data but we do not use them here:
#
# Population labels: WY, CO  # we could change order of populations
# Projections: 10, 10  # downsamples AFS
# Outgroup: False  # indicates if there is outgroup in data


# Output folder. It should be empty.
Output directory: gadma_result


# Set engine for simulations. We use default moments.
Engine: moments


# Now set our custom demographic model from file.
# There should be a function model_func in the file with a model.
Custom filename: demographic_model.py

# We could set optional settings about parameter labels,
# lower and upper bounds. But GADMA can extract it from provided
# file with model. If it fail then error will be printed and one
# should set at least parameter labels here.
#
# Parameter labels: nuW, nuC, T, m12, m21
# Lower bound: 1e-2, 1e-2, 1e-15, 0, 0
# Upper bound: 100, 100, 5, 10, 10


# How many repeats to run and how many processes to use.
Number of repeats: 2
Number of processes: 2
