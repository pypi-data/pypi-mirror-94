=========================
Python Sympa SOAP Wrapper
=========================

Small wrapper that uses `ZEEP <https://pypi.org/project/zeep/>`_ to communicate with a SOAP endpoint linked to a Sympa
server, to let automation in lists creation.

Example
=======

Start by creating a new client, and log in.
Then, you can use some pre-constructed methods.

.. code-block:: python

    from sympasoap import Client

    client = Client("https://lists.example.com/sympa")
    client.login("admin@example.com", "MY_STRONG_PASSWORD")     # Get from env

    # Create a list of type hotline that is named automatically-created@lists.example.com with basic description
    client.create_list(list_name="automatically-created", subject="Automatically created list", template="hotline",
            description="This mailing list was created from a Python shell.", topic="computers/software")

    # Subscribe the email address toto@example.com with name "Toto TOTO" to the list automatically-created@lists.example.com
    # in non-quiet mode: the user will receive a notification that they got subscribed
    client.subscribe(email="toto@example.com", list_address="automatically-created", quiet=False, name="Toto TOTO")

    # Unsubscribe the email in quiet mode
    client.subscribe(email="toto@example.com", list_address="automatically-created", quiet=True)
