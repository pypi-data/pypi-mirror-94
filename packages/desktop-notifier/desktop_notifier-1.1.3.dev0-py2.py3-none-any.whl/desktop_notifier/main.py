    Uses different backends depending on the platform version and available services.
    All implementations will dispatch notifications without an event loop but will
    require a running event loop to execute callbacks when the end user interacts with a
    notification. On Linux, a asyncio event loop is required. On macOS, a CFRunLoop *in
    the main thread* is required. Packages such as :mod:`rubicon.objc` can be used to
    integrate asyncio with a CFRunLoop.

    :param app_name: Name to identify the application in the notification center. On
        Linux, this should correspond to the application name in a desktop entry. On
        macOS, this argument is ignored and the app is identified by the bundle ID of
        the sending program (e.g., Python).
    :param notification_limit: Maximum number of notifications to keep in the system's
        notification center. This may be ignored by some implementations.
