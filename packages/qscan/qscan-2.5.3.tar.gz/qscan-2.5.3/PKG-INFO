        ## Description
        
        This program allows you to scan in velocity any quasar spectrum and with any transitions. This is very similar to RDGEN but with a more stable display. One can also select the fitting regions and prepare a preliminary `fort.13` in order to start fitting with VPFIT.
        
        ## Installation & Dependencies
        
        The program can be installed very easily using the [pip Python package manager](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) as follows:
        
        ```bash
        sudo pip install qscan
        ```
        
        The program was built using the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/) as well as 4 external Python packages: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/).
        
        ## Usage
        
        The usage is pretty straightforward and corresponds to the following:
        
        ```bash
        qscan <spectrum> --option
        ```
