    "This notebook walks through the process of subclassing [`ChartPlot`](https://helipad.dev/functions/chartplot/) to create a new type of plot that we can use in a panel of the [`Charts`](https://helipad.dev/functions/charts/) visualizer. `ChartPlot` allows any model data to be represented by anything that can be done on a Matplotlib canvas, so we'll be dealing with the Matplotlib API in addition to the Helipad API. In this case, we'll be creating a spatial model and replacing the default spatial visualizer with a 3D bar chart."

    "First, our basic model setup. We instantiate the `helipad` object and set a few options. Importantly, we initialize a spatial network with [`heli.spatial()`](https://helipad.dev/functions/model/spatial/). In this case we have a 20&times;20 grid with half-weighted diagonal connections and wrapping across the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, `heli.spatial()` also registers the `Charts` visualizer and adds a `spatial` plot named `map` to it. We want to keep the `Charts` visualizer. However, we also want to replace the stock `spatial` plot with our own 3D map. Since `heli.spatial()` returns the map plot object, we can simply call `.remove()` on it, leaving us with an empty `Charts` visualizer."

    "From here we can get to the meat of the model. Each period, agents are going to be able to move to an adjacent cell. They choose which cell to move to based on an attractor that grows at a diminishing rate with local population, and a repulsor that grows linearly with population. Thus, we get urban areas with outlying suburbs, depending on how strong the attractor and repulsor are relative to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll create parameters to weight the attractor and the repulsor, and then functions to calculate them for each patch. The attractor is the population on the patch, plus half the population of its direct neighbors and a quarter of the population of its diagonal neighbors, square rooted and multiplied by the attractor weight. The repulsor is simply the local population times the repulsor weight. The `netAttractor()` property returns the difference between the two."
