The sensormapgeo package was developed within the context of the EnMAP project supported by the DLR Space
Administration with funds of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (on the basis of a decision
by the German Bundestag: 50 EE 1529) and contributions from DLR, GFZ and OHB System AG.

This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
