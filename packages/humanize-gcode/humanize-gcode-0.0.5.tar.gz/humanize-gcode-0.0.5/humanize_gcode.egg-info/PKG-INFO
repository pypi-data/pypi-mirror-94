Description: # humanize-gcode
        
        A tool for explaining the commands in machine readable GCode files.
        
        Based on the specified GCode flavour, the tool parses a list of GCode commands and their description from the flavour's documentation. With this library it parses the input file and explains the effect of each command.
        
        #### Installation
        
        The utility is available on PyPi, so it can be installed with `pip`:
        
        `pip3 install humanize-gcode`
        
        #### Usage
        
        The package comes with the executable script `hucode` that accepts two arguments. The GCode flavour (currently only `marlin/smoothie` are supported) and the name of the file to annotate (or `-` for stdin).
        
        ##### Example usage
        
        `~ hucode smoothie testfile.gcode`

        #### TODO
        
        - More output formats (and possibly customization?)
        - More supported GCode flavours
        - Use command arguments to influence annotation
