robotpy-cppheaderparser
=======================

|Build Status|

CppHeaderParser is a pure python C++ header parser that parses C++
headers and creates a data structure that you can use to do many types
of things. We’ve found it particularly useful for creating programs that
generate python wrappers around existing C++ programs.

robotpy-cppheaderparser is a fork of the `CppHeaderParser`_ library
originally created by @senex. CppHeaderParser is an excellent library
and critical to some of the stuff we do in the RobotPy project.
Unfortunately, the maintainer seems to be busy, so
robotpy-cppheaderparser was born.

We aim to maintain (some) compatibility with the existing code and make
improvements and bugfixes as we need them -- though some decisions made
early on in this code's development means some compatibility may be broken
as things get fixed.

If you find an bug, we encourage you to submit a pull request! New
changes will only be accepted if there are tests to cover the change you
made (and if they don’t break existing tests).

.. note:: CppHeaderParser only does some very minimal interpretation of
          preprocessor directives -- and we're looking at removing some
          of that from this library. If you need anything complex, you
          should preprocess the code yourself. You can use the excellent
          pure python preprocessor `pcpp`_, or the preprocessing facilities
          provided by your favorite compiler.
