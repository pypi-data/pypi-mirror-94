        ## Releasing
        
        This project uses Rever and GitHub actions for releasing a new package version.
        
        Make sure your current environment has [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/) installed. You can create an environment just for the package releasing:
        
        ```bash
        conda env create -n ibis-mssql-release --file envs/release.yaml
        ```
        
        Activate your new environment:
        
        ```sh
        conda activate ibis-mssql-release
        ```
        
        Run `rever check` to check your `rever` configuration is correct.
        
        ```bash
        rever check
        ```
        
        Delete the rever folder to start a clean release.
        
        ```bash
        rm -rf rever/
        ```
        
        Lets start the releasing process!
        
        ```
        Note: Maybe you want to have a fresh clone just for releasing.
        ```
        
        ```
        Note: For releasing, you probably want to clone directly from the upstream repository.
        ```
        
        ```
        Note: Ensure you have permissions to push changes to the repository.
        ```
        
        Ensure you are using the latest version of the master branch:
        
        ```sh
        git fetch --all
        # if the repository is set as origin
        git checkout origin/master
        # or, if the repository is set as upstream
        git checkout upstream/master
        ```
        
        Now, if you want to release the version `0.1.5`
        (please, first check the latest version released), run:
        
        ```sh
        rever 0.1.5
        ```
        
        After that, you can push the changes to upstream:
        
        ```sh
        git push
        ```
