        ## Goal
        
        The goal of this software is to offer a solution for a Name Assigning Authority to distribute Archival Resources Keys and maintain basic information about the resources. It offers a database, command-line tools and an HTTP API.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        - Python 3.6+ (async/await, secrets)
        - PostgreSQL 9.4+ (jsonb)
        
        ## Install
        
        Create a virtualenv and activate it:
        
        ```
        python3 -m venv venv
        . ./venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        Create a database and then override default env vars:
        
        ```
        export ARK_SERVER_PGSQL_HOST=[pg_hostname]
        ```
        
        ```
        export ARK_SERVER_PGSQL_USER=[pg_user]
        ```
        
        ```
        export ARK_SERVER_PGSQL_PASSWORD=[pg_password]
        ```
        
        ```
        export ARK_SERVER_DEBUG=0  # don't set to 1 in production
        ```
        
        ```
        export ARK_SERVER_WORKERS=4  # as much as available cpu cores
        ```
        
        Install Ark server:
        
        ```
        pip install ark-server-CERTIC
        ```
        
        Create tables:
        
        ```
        ark install
        ```
        
        ## Command-line tools
        
        All command-line tools support ```-h``` flag for help.
        
        ### Install (or re-install)
        
        This command initializes the database.
        **Warning !** This will wipe all data in your ARK database.
        
        ```
        ark install
        ```
        
        ### Start web server
        
        ```
        ark run-server
        ```
        
        ### Run tests
        
        (Start web server first !)
        
        ```
        pytest -vv tests.py
        ```
        
        ### Add API account
        
        ```
        ark make-api-access
        ```
        
        Would generate the following output:
        
        ```
        Access granted to untitled app
        id    : 3
        secret: @-lQ,x}aZIT%Q}X&Dg!){zeq`pN:TOPt
        ```
        
        Use ```ark make-api-access -h``` for help.
        
        ### CSV import
        
        For mass-creation or update of ARK names. Must have columns app_id, ark_location, ark_name (empty value for creation). Any other column will be treated as meta:
        
        ```
        ark csv-import /path/to/some/file.csv
        ```
        
        A csv file is generated at /path/to/some/file-out.csv with added ARK names for creations.
        
        
        ## Basic Resolver
        
        ```https://yourhost.tld/ark:[your NAAN]/[ARK id]``` will redirect you to the location available in the db.
        
        ## ReSTish API
        
        - An endpoint is available at http://whatever-your-host-is.tld/api/v1/
        - Available HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT to respectively read, create or update ARKs to the database
        - JSON body is used for POST and PUT
        
        For POST and PUT, an Authorization HTTP header must contain a hmac256 of the request body, signed with your secret key (see [Add API account](#add-api-account) to generate your key). Example:
        
        ```
        Authorization:16ac7bd2c03200935d72c3acbaaaf637afc7ba417d0bf6a4429379634268ecda
        ```
        POST and PUT requests must also include the current Unix Epoch and the app_id.
        
        ### Read
        
        ```
        GET /api/v1/?ark=[NAAN]/[ARK_ID]
        ```
        
        If ARK exists, will return a response with a JSON body such as this:
        
        ```
        {
            "ark_location": "http://somewhere.tld/some-resource/", 
            "ark_metas": 
            {
                "who": "someone", 
                "what": "something", 
                "where": "somewhere" 
            }
        }
        ```
        
        ### Create
        
        ```
        POST /api/v1/
        ```
        
        With such JSON body:
        
        ```
        {
            "app_id": 1,
            "timestamp": 1530798110,
            "ark_location": "http://somewhere.tld/some-resource/",
            "ark_metas": 
            {
                "who": "someone", 
                "what": "something", 
                "where": "somewhere" 
            }
        }
        ```
        
        A status code 200 is returned with a response body containing the ARK name. Example:
        
        ```
        44804/MGQP4QLZ
        ```
        
        ### Update
        
        ```
        PUT /api/v1/
        ```
        
        With such JSON body:
        
        ```
        {
            "app_id": 1,
            "timestamp": 1530798110,
            "ark_name": "44804/MGQP4QLZ"
            "ark_location": "http://somewhere.tld/some-resource/",
            "ark_metas": 
            {
                "who": "someone", 
                "what": "something", 
                "where": "somewhere" 
            }
        }
        ```
        
        A status code 200 is returned.
        
        ### API errors
        
        Appropriate HTTP status codes are used (500, 400, 403, etc). Treat anything other than 200 as an error.
        
        ### Batch mode
        
        An additional POST endpoint at ```/api/v1/batch/``` supports batch requests with mixed create, read or update. JSON document payload looks like this:
        
        ```
        {
            "app_id": 1,
            "timestamp": 1530798110,
            "items":[
                ["r", "44408/TJX", null, null],
                ["c", null, "http://somewhere.tld/some-resource/", {
                    "who": "someone", 
                    "what": "something", 
                    "where": "somewhere"}],
                ["u", "44408/JBN", "http://somewhere.tld/some-resource/", {
                    "who": "someone", 
                    "what": "something", 
                    "where": "somewhere"}]
            ]
        }
        ```
        
        Each items is an array with the following informations: [crud_operation, ark_name, ark_location, ark_metas].
        Letters "r", "c", "u" are used to explicitely indicate a read, a create or an update on the item. Unknown parameters are set to null.
        
        The JSON payload MUST be gzip-encoded in the request body. As usual, the request MUST contain an authorization header signin the request body.
        
        A (gzipped) response is sent with the completed items:
        
        ```
        [
                ["r", "44408/TJX", "http://somewhere.tld/more-resource/", {
                    "who": "someone", 
                    "what": "something", 
                    "where": "somewhere"}],
                ["c", "44408/FC2S", "http://somewhere.tld/some-resource/", {
                    "who": "someone", 
                    "what": "something", 
                    "where": "somewhere"}],
                ["u", "44408/JBN", "http://somewhere.tld/some-resource/", {
                    "who": "someone", 
                    "what": "something", 
                    "where": "somewhere"}]
        ]
        ```
