## Introduction


### Dependencies
* Python (>= 3.6)
* Numpy (>= 1.18.1)
* pygmo (>= 2.13.0) 

### User installation
Install the [current PyPI release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pfevaluator):
```bash
pip install pfevaluator     
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thieu1995/pfevaluator
```

### Pareto front Performance Metrics

##### Closeness: Metrics Measuring the Closeness of the Solutions to the True Pareto Front
1. GD: Generational Distance
2. IGD: Inverted Generational Distance
3. MPFE: Maximum Pareto Front Error

##### Closeness - Diversity: Metrics Measuring the Closeness of the Solutions to the True Pareto Front
1. HV: Hyper Volume (Using Different Library)
2. HAR: Hyper Area Ratio (Using Different Library)

##### Distribution: Metrics Focusing on Distribution of the Solutions
1. UD: Uniform Distribution
2. S: Spacing
3. STE: Spacing To Extend
4. NDC: Number of Distinct Choices (Not Implemented Yet)

##### Ratio: Metrics Assessing the Number of Pareto Optimal Solutions in the Set
1. RNI: Ratio of Non-dominated Individuals
2. ER: Error Ratio
3. ONVG: Overall Non-dominated Vector Generation
4. PDI: Pareto Dominance Indicator (Not Implemented Yet)

##### Spread: Metrics Concerning Spread of the Solutions
1. MS: Maximum Spread 


### Examples
```code 

+ front: the file contains class Metric for evaluating all posible solution (population of obtained fronts).
+ pfront (Pareto front): the file contains class Metric for evaluating the obtained front from each test case.
+ tpfront: (True pareto front): the file contains class Metric for evaluating the obtained front and True pareto front
 (Reference front). Means, you need to pass the Reference front in this class.

+ True pareto front (Reference front) can be obtained by:
    1) You provide it (If you know the True Pareto front for your problem)
    2) Calculate from all possible fronts obtained from all test case.
        + Assumption you have N1 algorithms to test. 
        + Each algorithm give you a Obtained front. 
        + Each algorithm you run N2 independent trials --> Number of all possible fronts: N1 * N2 
        + Pass all N1*N2 front in our function to calculate the Non-donminated Solutions (Reference front
 - Approximate Pareto front - True Pareto front)


import pfevaluator

## Some avaiable performance metrics for evaluate each type of Pareto front.
pfront_metrics = ["UD", "NDC"]
tpfront_metrics = ["ER", "ONVG", "MS", "GD", "IDG", "MPFE", "S", "STE"]
volume_metrics = ["HV", "HAR"]

pm = pfevaluator.metric_pfront(obtained_front, pfront_metrics)              # Evaluate for each algorithm in each trial
tm = pfevaluator.metric_tpfront(obtained_front, reference_front, tpfront_metrics)        # Same above
vm = pfevaluator.metric_volume(obtained_front, reference_front, volume_metrics, None, all_fronts=matrix_fitness)

## obtained_front: is your front you found in each test case (each trial of each algorithm)
## reference_front (True Pareto front): is your True Pareto front of your problem.
##      If you don't know your True Pareto front, do the above step to get it from population of obtained fronts.
##      Using this function: reference_front = pfevaluator.find_reference_front(matrix_fitness)
##          matrix_fitness is all of your fronts in all test cases.

## The results is dict such as:     pm = { "UD": 0.2, "NDC": 0.1 }
