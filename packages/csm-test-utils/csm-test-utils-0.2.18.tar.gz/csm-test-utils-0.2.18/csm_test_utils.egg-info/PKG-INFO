        This repository contains set of simple Go- and Python-based utils for
        testing of CSM-created infrastructure
        
        Why use Go for tests?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Some times *go* works several times faster and code seems to be
           simplier.
        
        -  Already built test app doesn't have any requirements, *Python* for
           tests leads to increasing number of used libraries.
        
        -  Doesn't depend on Python version
        
        -  It's fun
        
        Why use Python for tests?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Simple
        -  No need to compile
        
        *Language by default to be used for tests is Python 3.7+*
