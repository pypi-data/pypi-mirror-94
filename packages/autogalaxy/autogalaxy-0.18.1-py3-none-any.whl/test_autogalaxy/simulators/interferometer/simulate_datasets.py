"""
Welcome to the PyAutoGalaxy dataset generator. Here, we'll make the datasets that we use to test and profile
PyAutoGalaxy. This consists of the following sets of images:

- Visibilities where the galaxy is an elliptical Dev Vaucouleurs profile.
- Visibilities where the galaxy is a bulge (Dev Vaucouleurs) + Envelope (Exponential) profile.
- Visibilities where there are two galaxies both composed of Sersic bulges.
- Visibilities where the galaxy is an elliptical Dev Vaucouleurs profile with a centre offset from the image centre.

Each image is generated for one instrument.

# To simulate each galaxy, we pass it an instrument and call its simulate function.
