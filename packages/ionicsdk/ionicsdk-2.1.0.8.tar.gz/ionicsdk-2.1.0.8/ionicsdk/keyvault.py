        All the basic functionality of managing keys is here.
        
    Error Codes:    
    - ISKEYVAULT_OK - Success code.
    - ISKEYVAULT_ERROR_BASE - error code range base.
    - ISKEYVAULT_ERROR - A general error occurred, but its specific problem is not represented with its own code.
    - ISKEYVAULT_UNKNOWN - An unknown and unexpected error occurred.
    - ISKEYVAULT_NOMEMORY - A memory allocation failed. This can happen if there is not a sufficient amount of
            memory available to perform an operation.
    - ISKEYVAULT_MISSINGVALUE - An expected and required value was not found. This is typically emitted from
            functions that are responsible for parsing / deserializing data.
    - ISKEYVAULT_INVALIDVALUE - A value was found that is invalid. For example, a string value was expected, but
            it was actually an integer.  This is typically emitted from functions that are responsible for parsing
            deserializing data.
    - ISKEYVAULT_KEY_NOT_FOUND - A key was not found. This happens when attempting to access a key that does not
            exist, for example when trying to retrieve via GetKey(..) or update a key via SetKey(..).
    - ISKEYVAULT_KEY_UPDATE_IGNORED - A key update request was ignored. This happens when attempting to update a
            key via SetKey(), and the provided key is not newer than the key which already exists in the vault.
            This is not an error, per se, but it is informing the caller that the requested update is not needed, 
            and as such is ignored. The determination is made by comparing key issuance UTC time
            (KeyVaultKeyRecord.issuedServerTimeUtcSeconds).
    - ISKEYVAULT_OPENFILE - A file failed to open. This normally happens because the file path provided does not
            exist or it is not accessible due to lack of permission.
    - ISKEYVAULT_EOF - The end of a file was found before it was expected. This normally happens if the file has
            been truncated or is zero length.
    - ISKEYVAULT_NOHEADER - A file header could not be found where it was expected. This normally happens when
            trying to decrypt a file that is not encrypted, or the encrypted file has been corrupted.
    - ISKEYVAULT_PARSEFAILED - The parsing of some serialized data failed. This typically happens if a file or
            block of data is corrupted or of an unexpected format.
    - ISKEYVAULT_HEADER_MISMATCH - A key vault file header has values which were not expected. This typically
            happens when a key vault attempts to open a file that was saved by a different key vault type.  For
            example, if a Windows DPAPI key vault object attempts to open a file that was saved by a different
            key vault type (e.g. Apple Keychain key vault).
    - ISKEYVAULT_LOAD_NOT_NEEDED - A key vault load operation was skipped because it was not needed. This happens
            when a load operation is requested on a key vault, but the vault skipped the operation because it
            determined that the underlying storage data has not changed since the previous load operation.  A 
            key vault may do this in order to optimize execution time by avoiding costly loads from disk when
            possible.
    - ISKEYVAULT_CREATE_PATH - A key vault save operation could not create the required file path. This happens
            when a save operation is requested on a key vault, but the vault is unable to create the necessary
            folder path to store the file. For example, if the destination file path is /a/b/c/vault.dat, and
            the folder /a/b/c does not exist (or some part of it), then the key vault attempts to create the path.
            If the path cannot be created, then ISKEYVAULT_CREATE_PATH is returned.
    - ISKEYVAULT_INVALID_KEY - A key is invalid in some way (key ID, key bytes, etc). This may happen if a key
            was found to be invalid. For example, if the key is the wrong size (any size other than 32 bytes),
            the key ID string is empty or contains invalid characters, etc.
    - ISKEYVAULT_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND - A resource was not found. This happens when attempting to access a resource
            that does not exist.
    - ISKEYVAULT_FILE_VERSION - A key vault file load operation failed due to unsupported file version. This
            happens when a key vault attempts to load a file from disk, but the version of that file is not
            supported. This may happen when an older version of the SDK is used to load a file that was saved by
            a newer version of the SDK.
