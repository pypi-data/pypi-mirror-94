# asuna_api
Python wrapper for asuna.ga
I am not the creator the asuna api, and some of this code came from the [iDutchy some-random-api project](https://github.com/iDutchy/sr_api) so credits to them.
Credits to iDutchy for the Original source and Thank You for letting me for using your source.

For any questions and support for the wrapper, you can visit the [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/sHUQCch "JDJG Inc. Official's Blooper Server") or DM me on Discord at JDJG Inc. Official#3493.
