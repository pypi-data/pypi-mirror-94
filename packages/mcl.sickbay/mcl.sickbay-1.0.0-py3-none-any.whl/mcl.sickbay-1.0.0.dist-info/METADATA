# 👩‍⚕️ MCL Sickbay

"MCL Sickbay" is the data model and object-relational mapping for the clinical data application of the [Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/).


## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

The "Sickbay" software provides a [Python](https://python.org/) based API into a data model (a series of related classes) and takes advantage of [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the object-relational mapper. This section will help you get started.


### 📀 The Database

For this project, we're using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). You can create a PostgreSQL database to use with this software as follows:

```console
dropdb --if-exists clinical_data
dropuser --if-exists mcl

createuser \
    --createdb \
    --inherit \
    --login \
    --no-createrole \
    --no-superuser \
    mcl


createdb --encoding=UTF8 --owner=mcl clinical_data
```


### 🖥 The Software

To use this software, simply add `mcl.sickbay` as a dependency to your project or install it into your Python virtual environment.

You can develop, build, and test the package locally as follows:

```console
python3 bootstrap.py
bin/buildout
bin/test
```

You can run `bin/create-demo-db` to populate a PostgreSQL database with the schema of the Sickbay data model. Add ``-add-test-data`` to include some test data.

To publish this software, try [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/).


### 🔢 Versioning

We use the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) philosophy for versioning this software. For versions available, see the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/mcl.sickbay/#history).


## 📦 Additional Resources

-   [Common Data Elements](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/resources/standards/mcl-cdes)


## 👥 Contributing

Well it's wide open right now, but later you might look at [open issues](https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues), forking the project, and submitting a pull request.

## 📜 Changelog

This documents the changes from release to release.


### 0.0.10


For issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/1:

-   On `ClinicalCore`:
    -   The `race` attribute is now a 1-to-many mapping to `CoreRace` via `core_races`
    -   The `type_tobacco_used` is now a 1-to-many mapping to `CoreTobacco` via `core_tobaccos`
    -   The attribute `days_to_birth` is now required
-   On `Biospecimen`:
    -   The enumeration for `Precancers` has a whole bunch of new permitted values
-   On `BreastOrgan`:
    -   The enumeration for `PrecancerousHistopathology` contains values for "unknown" and "data not available"
    -   The enumeration for `BreastSite` now has an `unknown` value
    -   A new value `pending` is available for `GeneticTestingAnswer`, `TestResults`, `EstrogenTestResults`
    -   The enumeration `HER2Results` adds `pending` and `unknown` values
    -   The enumeration `BreastImagingWorkup` adds an `unknown` value
    -   The enumeration `BIRADSTissues` adds values for "unknown" and "data not available"
-   New `LungOrgan` plus (bogus) test data for it
-   New `PancreasOrgan` plus (bogus) test data for it
-   Updated `ProstateOrgan`
    -   Previously, this was just a placeholder to test multiple inheritance from the common `Organ` class in terms of both Python class hierachy and database hierarchy
    -   Now it's completely filled out with the `v0` prostate common data elements with its numerous controlled vocabularies
-   Expanded enumerations: `ClinicalMStage7`, `TStage7`, `ClinicalNStage7`, `GroupStage7`, `MarginalStatus`
-   New enumerations, far too many to enumerate 😏

For issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/4:

-   All fields in `LabCASMetadata` are now `String`.

For issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/3:

-   `inscribed_clinicalCore_participant_ID` is a new field on `PriorLesion`, `CoreRace`, and `CoreTobacco`
-   `inscribed_biospecimen_identifier` is a new field on `AdjacentSpecimen`

For issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/5:

-   The following updates diverge from the [data dictionaries](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/resources/standards/mcl-cdes) of the common data elements:
    -   `participant_ID` is now 50 characters (along with foreign keys and `inscribed` fields), up from 14
    -   `specimen_ID` is now 50 characters (along with foreign keys and `inscribed` fields), up from 16

And finally, for issue https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/6 … we add `unknown` to all enumerations that didn't have it already.



### 0.0.9

-   Rename `inscribed_participant_ID` → `inscribed_clinicalCore_participant_ID`
-   Rename `inscribed_specimen_ID` → `inscribed_biospecimen_specimen_ID`


### 0.0.8

-   Addresses https://github.com/MCLConsortium/mcl.sickbay/issues/2 by:
    -   Adding `inscribed_participant_ID` and `inscribed_specimen_ID` to `Genomics`
    -   Adding `inscribed_participant_ID` and `inscribed_specimen_ID` to `Imaging`
    -   Adding `inscribed_participant_ID` to `Biospecimen`
    -   (It also adds some test data to these fields.)


### 0.0.7

In this release:

-   The `labcasFileURL` field is now just `labcasID`; everything else is the same except the name (and the semantics; it no longer is used to hold URLs)
-   The `Organ` class now has an `inscribed_participant_ID` field you can use to note a future participant ID association with a `ClinicalCore`
-   All enumerations now use [advanced enumerations](https://pypi.org/project/aenum/) for their base class.
-   All enumerations now have a case-insensitive lookup.

The implications of that last bullet mean:

```python
>>> from mcl.sickbay.model.enums import Race
>>> Race.black_or_african_american == Race('Black or African American')
True
>>> Race.black_or_african_american == Race['Black or African American']
True
>>> Race.black_or_african_american == Race['black or african american']
True
>>> Race('black or african american')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: 'black or african american' is not a valid Race
```

So if you want case-insensitive lookups, use brackets, not parentheses.


### 0.0.6

In this release:

-   Base metadata for all classes now includes:
    -   `consortium`, a nullable string that can be used to contain an RDF URI to the consortium that originated the data, such as `https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/` for the Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions.
    -   `protocolID`, a nullable integer that tells the research protocol that generated the data.
-   Kristen's sample data (`--add-sample-data`) includes these consortium and protocol IDs


### 0.0.5

This release fixes:

-   In `BreastOrgan`, the field `her2_in_situ_hybridization` was the wrong enumerated type. It should've been `HER2InSituHybridization`.
-   In the enums, add the type `HER2InSituHybridization`.
-   Add test data from `12_78_BreastCore_20200625_0`.
-   Removed foreign key constraint from `Biospecimen.specimen_parent_ID` because the parent ID may be either another biospecimen or could be a participant (clinical core) object.
-   New class `AdjacentSpecimen` to work around circular dependency problem of having adjacent specimens directly on `Biospeciment`.
-   New JSON serialization for `adjacent_specimens` on `Biospecimen`
-   Misspelled enumeration `AnatomicalSite`: `pancrease` → `pancreas`
-   Change `create-demo-db` to `create-clinical-db` since this is no longer a demo but the real deal
-   Transition from old style `setup.py` to everything in `setup.cfg`

In this release, 0.0.5, we also finally start keeping a changelog 😮
