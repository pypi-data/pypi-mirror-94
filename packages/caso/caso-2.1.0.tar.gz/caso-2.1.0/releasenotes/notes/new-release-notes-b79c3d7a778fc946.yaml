    Starting with this version cASO release notes are published within the
    documentation. This version is a major release that implements IP
    accounting record, as well as several bugfixes. There are no upgrade notes
    to take into account.
features:
  - |
    New IP accounting record is implemented. Now cASO is able to extract IP
    accounting and publish it using its JSON rendering. No new configuration
    needs to be done, but the cASO user needs to have access to the Neutron
    endpoints.
  - |
    cASO now allows to specity the projects to extract records from as project
    IDs, rather than names. When dealing with different identity domains this
    is troublesome, therefore we need to allow users to specify project IDs 
    rather than names.
fixes:
  - Define the correct entrypoints for the V2 and V4 messengers.
  - Generate LOG warnings when mappings cannot be found.
