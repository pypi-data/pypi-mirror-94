"""
Controller for global scope state

Basically we use scoping to prevent us from assessing our own code. Scope
improves performance but it also prevents us from accidentally recursing
inside our analysis code. For example, we don't want to inadvertently cause
string propagation events while we're doing string building for reporting
purposes.

Currently there are several types of scope that we use. However, it is
likely that these are redundant and we should consolidate them into a
single contrast scope. This would be in line with changes that the Ruby
agent recently made.

    disabling contrast scope. The original scope level will be restored when the
