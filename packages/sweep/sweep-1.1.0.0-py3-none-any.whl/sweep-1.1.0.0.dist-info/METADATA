SWeeP Overview
====================
This package is a python version of the tool described in the article available at <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55627-4>. **Please quote the article**.

Use
------------
To use SWeeP in python, install the package with the command "pip install sweep" and import the package in your code, as in the example:

.. code-block:: python

    from sweep import fastaread, fas2sweep
    fasta = fastaread ("fasta_file_path")
    vect = fas2sweep (fasta)

The default configurations are intended for vectorization of amino acid sequences. The default output is the matrix already projected, with 600 columns. **See the article if you need information about the projection method**.

The default projection matrix has dimensions 160000x600. It is necessary generate a new matrix if other masks are used or another projection size is desired. To generate the orthonormal matrix for projection, a function called orthbase is available on the package. For example, if the goal is to change the projection size to 300, just use:

.. code-block:: python

    from sweep import fastaread, fas2sweep, orthbase
    ob = orthbase(160000,300)
    fasta = fastaread ("fasta_file_path")
    vect = fas2sweep (fasta, orth_mat = ob)

It is also possible obtain the result without projection, for this is necessary set the parameter "projection" to "False".

For the nucleotide sequences vectorization is possible set the parameter fasta_type to "NT".
