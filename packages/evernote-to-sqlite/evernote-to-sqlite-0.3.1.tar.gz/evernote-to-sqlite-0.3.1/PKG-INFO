        Tools for converting Evernote content to SQLite. See [Building an Evernote to SQLite exporter](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/16/building-evernote-sqlite-exporter/) for background on this project.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install this tool using `pip`:
        
            $ pip install evernote-to-sqlite
        
        ## Usage
        
        Currently the only available command is `evernote-to-sqlite enex`, which converts Evernote's ENEX export files into a SQLite database.
        
        You can create an ENEX export in the Evernote desktop application by selecting some notes (or all of your notes) and using the `File -> Export Notes...` menu option.
        
        You can convert that file to SQLite like so:
        
            $ evernote-to-sqlite enex evernote.db MyNotes.enex
        
        This will display a progress bar and create a SQLite database file called `evernote.db`.
        
        ### Limitations
        
        Unfortunately the ENEX export format does not include a unique identifier for each note. This means you cannot use this tool to re-import notes after they have been updated - you should consider this tool to be a one-time transformation of an ENEX file into an equivalent SQLite database.
        
        ENEX exports also do not include details of which notebook a note belongs to.
        
        ## Development
        
        To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
        
            cd evernote-to-sqlite
            python -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Or if you are using `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv shell
        
        Now install the dependencies and tests:
        
            pip install -e '.[test]'
        
        To run the tests:
        
            pytest
