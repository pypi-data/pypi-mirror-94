Matrix Sampler
==============

.. figure:: icons/matrix-sampler.png

Samples a relation matrix.

Signals
-------

**Inputs**:

-  **Data**

Data set.

**Outputs**:

-  **In-sample Data**

   Selected data.

-  **Out-of-the-sample Data**

   Remaining data.

Description
-----------

This widget samples the input data and sends both the sampled and the
remaining data to the output. It is useful for evaluating the
performance of recommendation systems.

1. Select the desired *sampling method*:

   -  **rows** (randomly samples entire matrix rows)
   -  **columns** (randomly samples entire matrix columns)
   -  **rows and columns** (samples from the entire matrix)
   -  **entries** (randomly samples individual matrix elements)

2. Select the proportion of the data you want at the output.
3. Press **Apply** to commit the changes.

Example
-------

**Matrix Sampler** widget samples data into two subsets: in-sample and
out-of-the-sample data. This is useful if you want to check the accuracy
of matrix reconstruction with **Completion Scoring**. Feed in-sample
data into the **Fusion Graph** to reconstruct the matrix and then
compare the results with out-of-the-sample data.
