Table to Relation
=================

.. figure:: icons/table-to-relation.png

Converts a data table into a relation matrix. Labels objects in rows and
columns of a relation matrix.

Signals
-------

**Inputs**:

-  **Data**

   Attribute-valued data set.

**Outputs**:

-  **Relation**

   Relationships between two groups of objects.

Description
-----------

**Table to Relation** widget is probably the most often used widget in
the data fusion set. It allows you to define relations just by labeling
the axes. Your data set from the **File** widget will be transformed
into a relation matrix, which can be later fused together with other
relation matrices into a collective latent data model.

1. Provide a descriptive name for the relation. Option
   `*transpose* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose>`__ will shift
   the axes.
2. Label the object type in columns. Your entry will be displayed on top
   of the table. Note that the labels are case-sensitive.
3. Label the object type in rows. If there is a label present in the
   data, it will be used as default.
4. If *Auto send* is ticked, your changes will be communicated
   automatically. Alternatively click *Send*.

Example
-------

In the example below we took two regular files with data on movie
ratings and movie genres and fed them into separate **Table to
Relation** widgets. In these widgets we specified the relations
contained in the data and named the axes accordingly. See how **Fusion
Graph** is then able to organize data sets into a relational graph, i.e.
a data fusion graph, simply on the basis of axes names?
