Completion Scoring
==================

.. figure:: icons/completion-scoring.png

Scores the quality of matrix completion using root mean squared error
(RSME) metric.

Signals
-------

**Inputs**:

-  **Fitted fusion graph**

   Fitted collective latent data model.

-  **Relation**

   Relationships between two groups of objects.

**Outputs**:

-  (None)

Description
-----------

This widget assesses the quality of matrix completion based on root mean
squared error metric
(`RMSE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation>`__).
Each row contains scores representing matrix completion quality of
different relations. Results for prediction models are in columns.

Example
-------

**Completion Scoring** widget assesses the quality of matrix completion
using the RMSE metric. Connect it with **Matrix Sampler** to score
prediction models (previously learnt on in-sample data) on
out-of-the-sample data. You can also use **Mean Fuser** to get a mean
score for latent values.
