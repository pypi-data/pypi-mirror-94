Statistical analyses will be performed with the genome-wide imputed dataset,
which include \VAR{ nb_good_sites } imputed variants (done with an information
threshold of $\geq\VAR{ info_threshold }$, and a completion rate of
$\geq\VAR{ rate_threshold }$\% at an imputation probability threshold of
$\geq\VAR{ prob_threshold }$\%). This total includes \VAR{ nb_genotyped }
previously genotyped variants.\\

All files were generated in the \texttt{\VAR{ output_dir }} directory and were
separated by chromosomes (\texttt{\VAR{ output_dir_chrom }} directories). The
final (merged) results (generated by IMPUTE2) are located in the
\texttt{\VAR{ output_final_impute2 }} directories. All the output files are
described below.
