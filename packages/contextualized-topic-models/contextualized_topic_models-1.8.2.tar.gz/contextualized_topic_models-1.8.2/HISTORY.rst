1.8.2 (2021-02-08)
------------------

* removed constraint over pytorch version. This should solve problems for Windows users

1.8.0 (2021-01-11)
------------------

* novel way to handle text, we now allow for an easy usage of training and testing data
* better visualization of the training progress and of the sampling process
* removed old stuff from the documentation

1.7.1 (2020-12-17)
------------------

* some minor updates to the documentation
* adding a new method to visualize the topic using a wordcloud
* save and load will now generate a warning since the feature has not been tested


1.7.0 (2020-12-10)
------------------

* adding a new and much simpler way to handle text for topic modeling

1.6.0 (2020-11-03)
------------------

* introducing the two different classes for ZeroShotTM and CombinedTM
* depracating CTM class in favor of ZeroShotTM and CombinedTM
