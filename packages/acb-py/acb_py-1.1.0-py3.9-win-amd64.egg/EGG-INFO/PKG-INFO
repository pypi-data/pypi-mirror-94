Description: ## acb.py
        
        For all your ACB extracting needs. Based on [VGMToolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/).
        
        HCA decryption is based on the 2ch HCA decoder. Thanks also to Headcrabbed who documented the new extra key [here](https://blog.mottomo.moe/categories/Tech/RE/en/2018-10-12-New-HCA-Encryption/).
        
        Usage:
        
        ```sh
        python3 setup.py install
        python3 -m acb somefile.acb output
        # equivalent
        acbextract somefile.acb output
        ```
        
        You can also pass `--disarm-with=key1,key2` to have the library decrypt (but not decode) files for you. The key format
        `--disarm-with=k1,k2` is equivalent to `hca_decoder -a k1 -b k2`, but you can also combine them into a 64-bit hex integer.
        This also supports AWB embedded keys (see [here](https://github.com/hozuki/libcgss/issues/4)).
        If you use disarm heavily, you should also install the `_acb_speedup` C extension in the `fast_sub`
        directory. It will substantially speed up the decryption process.
