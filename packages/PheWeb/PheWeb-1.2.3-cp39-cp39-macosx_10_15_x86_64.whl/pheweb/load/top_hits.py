Make lists of top hits for this PheWeb in {} and {}.

To count as a top hit, a variant must:
- have a p-value < {}
- be among the top {:,} associations in its phenotype
- have the smallest p-value within {:,} bases within its phenotype (well, not exactly, but pretty much)

Some loci may have hits for multiple phenotypes.  If you want a list of loci with
just the top phenotype for each, use `pheweb top-loci`.
