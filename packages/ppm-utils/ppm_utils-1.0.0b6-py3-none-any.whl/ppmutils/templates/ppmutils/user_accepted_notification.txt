We will also reach out to you for any required signatures as we begin to collect your medical records and access previous pathology samples for DNA sequencing.  Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about any part of the study.

If you no longer wish to be enrolled in this study, please contact us as soon as possible and we will remove your information from the system.
