This package is a graphical interface wrapper for sklearn classification.
It is intended to be used with the [ml-bio-workshop](https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop) training materials.

## Python environment

Requires:
- Python 3.5
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- pyqt 5
- scipy

See `conda_env.yml` for one set of compatible package versions.
Create the `ml4bio` [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with the command `conda env create -f conda_env.yml`.
On Linux, activate the environment with `source activate ml4bio`.
On Windows, activate the environment with `activate ml4bio`.

The full Anaconda installation also provides all required dependencies.

## Running

The ml-bio-workshop repository provides [scripts](https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml-bio-workshop/tree/master/scripts) for installing and launching the ml4bio GUI.
Once the ml4bio package and its dependencies have been installed, the GUI can be launched using the `ml4bio` command from the command line.
