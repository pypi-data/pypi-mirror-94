# Akita Flask Integration

This package extends `flask.testing.FlaskClient` in order to instrument Flask
integration tests, capturing requests and responses to the service under test.
You can drop in `akita_flask.testing.HarClient` everywhere you use Flasks's
`FlaskClient`, and Akita will use your integration tests to build a spec for
your service.

Why build specs?  A spec shows your service's APIs.  Using Akita to build specs
from your integration tests makes it clear what APIs your code implements --
and you can diff specs, showing what impact a code change will have on your
customers.  For more info, see [Catching Breaking Changes
Faster](https://docs.akita.software/docs) in the Akita docs.

## See it in Action

Take a look at the [Akibox Flask
Tutorial](https://github.com/akitasoftware/akibox-flask), which
implements a toy Dropbox-like file server and tests it using the Akita Flask
Integration.
