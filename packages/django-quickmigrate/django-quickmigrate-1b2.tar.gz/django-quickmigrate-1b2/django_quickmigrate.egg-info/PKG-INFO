Description: Quick migrations via manage.py
        =
        
        When executed without arguments, it will search for the `QUICK_MIGRATE` setting in settings.py,
        make migrations for every app in it and apply them.
        
        Otherwise, it will do the same only upon apps given as arguments.
        
        Prompt
        `py manage.py quickmigrate -h`
        for more specific details on arguments _or_ read the docs below.
        
        Quickstart
        =
        
        Installation
        --
        
        1. Open your Django project and activate _virtual environment_.
        
        2. After activating virtual environment install the package using 
        `pip install django-quickmigrate`
        
        3. Open your settings.py and add `'quickmigrate'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`
        
        4. Add additional list `QUICK_MIGRATE` into your settings. It should look pretty much
        like `INSTALLED_APPS`, except you fill it only with apps you want to be migrated when you
        call `py manage.py quickmigrate` without arguments.
        
        5. And that's it. Now you can use `quickmigrate` in your project!
        
        Additional arguments
        --
        
        Quickmigrate allows you to choose a variety of apps to migrate during one call.
        
        You can manipulate this using additional arguments listed below:
        1. `-i`, `--inst` — command will look at your `INSTALLED_APPS` instead of `QUICK_MIGRATE`.
        In its turn, this flag takes one optional argument: either `base` or `all` (defaults to `all`).
            + `base` will just call
            `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands. As the result, only basic apps such as `admin` will be migrated.
            + `all` will make and apply migrations for all `INSTALLED_APPS` which support migrations.
        
        2. `-a`, `--apps` — command will look for specific apps. It can take any amount of arguments
        starting from 1.   
        **e.g.** `py manage.py quickmigrate --apps myapp1 myapp2 admin auth`
        
        With no arguments provided, the command will look in your `QUICK_MIGRATE` setting.
