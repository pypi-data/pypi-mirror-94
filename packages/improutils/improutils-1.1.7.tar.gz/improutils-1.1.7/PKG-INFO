        ### How to deploy a new version
        This repository uses GitLab CI/CD Pipelines to deploy improutils package either to production or test PyPI.
        
        #### Steps to release a new version to production PyPI
         - Commit your local changes
        	 - ```git commit -m "Add awesome AI feature" ```
         - Create a tag version with respect to [semantic versioning rules](https://semver.org/)
        	 - ```git tag 'x.x.x'```
         - Push tag to origin
        	 - ```git push --tags```
         - Wait for the package to be deployed and then check new version at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/improutils/)
        
        #### Steps to release a new version to test PyPI
        Almost same as above, but the **create and push tag step** must be skipped. Testing version is available at [test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/improutils/).
