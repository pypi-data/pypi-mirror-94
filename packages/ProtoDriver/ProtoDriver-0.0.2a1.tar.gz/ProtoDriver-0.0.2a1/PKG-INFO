Description: # ProtoDriver
        A simple Raspberry Pi web api for driving a MAX7219 dot matrix display
        
        This package is meant to be ran as a REST API and be called from a dedicated frontend.
        
        ProtoDriver has only just been brought to a usable level and is in no way production ready.
