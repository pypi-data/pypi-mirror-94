type = """
An instant of physical time.

The instant represented by %1$s is not connected to any specific calendar and
clock representation or any particular geographical location or time zone.  It
represents an actual physical time.

An intance can represent any time between %2$s and %3$s.

A time's representation is an approximation of an infinitessimal instant of
continuuous time in the same way that a floating point value is an approimation
of a real number.  A time value actually represents a very short interval of
time; the `RESOLUTION` class attribute is an approximation of the length of that
interval.

Internally, a time is represented as an integral number of ticks of size
`RESOLUTION` from a base time.  The number of ticks is the instance's _offset_.


# Constructor

Generally, times are specificed with a local date, daytime, and time zone.  See
_Localizing_ below.  

Use `from_offset()` to construct an instance from ticks.


# Exceptions

Methods may raise these exceptions:

- `OverflowError`: The method produces a time that is not between `MIN` and
  `MAX`.


# Localizing

**FIXME:** Write this.
