issues:
  - If a VM being a part of some shared-ip group is attached to the network
    which is not owned by the current tenant (shared network) a policy
    violation may occur thus failing the deployment.

fixes:
  - Murano no longer specifies fixed-ip parameter for ports when creating VMs
    attached to networks owned and shared by other tenants. Specifying this
    parameter for non-owned networks could cause violation of neutron policies.
