    Added a new yaql function 'decryptData' which pairs with 'encryptData' on
    the dashboard side. Application authors can use these functions to secure
    sensitive input to their Murano applications such as passwords.

    Requires a valid secret storage backend (e.g. Barbican) to be configured
    via Castellan.
