features:
  - It is now possible to configure the notifications to use a different
    transport URL than the RPCs. These could potentially be completely
    different message broker hosts (though they doesn't need to be). If the
    notification-specific configuration is not provided, the notifier will use
    the same transport as the RPCs.
