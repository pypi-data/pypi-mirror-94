        ## Documentation
        
        ### Setup
        
        Enable the plugin in your `mkdocs.yml`:
        
        ```yaml
        plugins:
          - include-markdown
        ```
        
        ### Reference
        
        This plugin provides two directives, one to include markdown files and another
        to include files of any type. Paths of included files can be absolute or
        relative to the path of the file that includes them:
        
        #### **`include-markdown`**
        
        Includes markdown file content, optionally using two delimiters to filter the
        content to include.
        
        - **start**: Delimiter that marks the beginning of the content to include.
        - **end**: Delimiter that marks the end of the content to include.
        - **preserve_includer_indent** (*true*): When this option is enabled, every
         line of the content to include is indented with the same number of spaces
         used to indent the includer `{% %}` template. Possible values are `true` and
         `false`.
        - **dedent** (*false*): If enabled, the included content will be dedented.
        - **rewrite_relative_urls** (*true*): When this option is enabled (default),
         Markdown links and images in the content that are specified by a relative URL
         are rewritten to work correctly in their new location. Possible values are
         `true` and `false`.
        - **comments** (*true*): When this option is enabled (default), the content to
         include is wrapped by `<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE -->` and `<!-- END INCLUDE -->`
         comments which help to identify that the content has been included. Possible
         values are `true` and `false`.
        
        > Note that the **start** and **end** strings may contain usual (Python-style)
        escape sequences like `\n`, which is handy if you need to match on a multi-line
        start or end trigger.
        
        ##### Examples
        
        ```jinja
        {%
           include-markdown "../README.md"
           start="<!--intro-start-->"
           end="<!--intro-end-->"
        %}
        ```
        
        ```jinja
        {%
           include-markdown "docs/includes/header.md"
           start="<!--\n\ttable-start\n-->"
           end="<!--\n\ttable-end\n-->"
           rewrite_relative_urls=false
           comments=false
        %}
        ```
        
        #### **`include`**
        
        Includes the content of a file.
        
        - **start**: Delimiter that marks the beginning of the content to include.
        - **end**: Delimiter that marks the end of the content to include.
        - **preserve_includer_indent** (*true*): When this option is enabled, every
         line of the content to include is indented with the same number of spaces
         used to indent the includer `{% %}` template. Possible values are `true` and
         `false`.
        - **dedent** (*false*): If enabled, the included content will be dedented.
        
        > Note that the **start** and **end** strings may contain usual (Python-style)
        escape sequences like `\n`, which is handy if you need to match on a multi-line
        start or end trigger.
        
        ##### Examples
        
        ```jinja
        ~~~yaml
        {% include "../examples/github-minimal.yml" %}
        ~~~
        ```
        
        ```jinja
            {%
              include "../examples/__main__.py"
              start="~~~yaml"
              end="~~~\n"
              preserve_includer_indent=true
            %}
        ```
