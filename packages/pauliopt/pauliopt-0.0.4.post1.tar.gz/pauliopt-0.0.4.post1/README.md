The [documentation](https://sg495.github.io/pauliopt/pauliopt/index.html) for this library was generated with [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/).
Jupyter notebooks exemplifying various aspects of the library are available in the [notebooks](./notebooks) folder.

**Please Note:** This software library is in a pre-alpha development stage. It is not currently suitable for use by the public.

You can install the library with `pip`:

```
pip install pauliopt
```

If you already have the library installed and would like the latest version, you can also upgrade with `pip`:

```
pip install --upgrade pauliopt
```

## Optimization of Circuits of Mixed ZX Phase Gadgets

**Step 1.** Create a circuit of Z and X phase gadgets.
