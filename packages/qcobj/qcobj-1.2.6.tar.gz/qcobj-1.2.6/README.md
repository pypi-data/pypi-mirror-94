### In short ###
A Python package to help scientists and researchers to add physical quantities

  ensure they are in the correct range and eventually converted to the
  requested unit of measurement. 

* A graphical user interface to display and modify configuration file content
  is included.

* More than two configuration files can be compared highlighting the
  differences between them.
