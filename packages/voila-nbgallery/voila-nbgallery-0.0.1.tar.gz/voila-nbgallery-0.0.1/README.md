# voila-nbgallery

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

**Experimental work in progress - subject to change!**

This project contains [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) templates to use in offline scenarios and/or in conjunction with [nbgallery](https://github.com/nbgallery/nbgallery).  These templates use jinja template inheritance to build on top of upstream templates maintained by the [Voila project](https://github.com/voila-dashboards).

## Templates in this package

 * **offline-lab** - Voila's default template, patched to work offline (nothing nbgallery-specific)
   * Patch for using [Qgrid](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) in conjunction with `enable_nbextensions=True` ([voila#72](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/issues/72))
   * Local copy of font-awesome stylesheet ([voila#539](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/issues/539))
 * **offline-gridstack** - [voila-gridstack](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack) template, patched to work offline (nothing nbgallery-specific)
   * Qgrid and font-awesome patches as above
   * Local copy of gridstack javascript and stylesheet ([voila-gridstack#26](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack/issues/26))
 * **nbgallery-material** - Prototype nbgallery template based on [voila-material](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-material)
   * Qgrid and font-awesome patches as above
   * Workaround for javascript widget error ([voila-material#22](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-material/issues/22))
   * Displays nbgallery metadata if present in the notebook
     * *Note: prototype only; nbgallery doesn't currently populate all the fields used by the template.*
   * Sets the nbgallery notebook and revision id as environment variables in the kernel - this can be used for provenance of external actions taken by the notebook
     * *Note: this only works if Voila is running as a server extention; in standalone mode, execute requests are blocked.*
     
See the [notebooks](https://github.com/nbgallery/voila-nbgallery/tree/main/notebooks) directory for some examples.

## Installation

If you plan to use only the offline-lab or nbgallery-material template:

```
pip install voila-nbgallery
```
We've listed [voila-gridstack](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack) as an optional dependency because it includes UI extensions for both Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook, and you may not want those if you're not using the gridstack template.  If you plan to use the offline-gridstack template, then install with the optional dependency:

```
pip install voila-nbgallery[gridstack]
```
