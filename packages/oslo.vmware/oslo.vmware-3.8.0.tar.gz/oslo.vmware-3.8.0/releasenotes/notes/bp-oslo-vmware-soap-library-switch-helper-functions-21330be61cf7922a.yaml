    ``ManagedObjectReference``'s ``value`` and ``_type`` attributes must not be
    used anymore in depending projects. Instead, ``vim_util.get_moref_value()``
    and ``vim_util.get_moref_type()`` have to be used, because with
    `this spec <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/oslo-specs/specs/victoria/oslo-vmware-soap-library-switch.html>`_
    we switch the backing SOAP library and different libraries have different
    representations of those attributes.
