upgrade:
  - Code accessing the ``cookiejar`` must use ``session.client.cookiejar``
    instead of the previous ``session.client.options.transport.cookiejar``,
    because with `this spec
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/oslo-specs/specs/victoria/oslo-vmware-soap-library-switch.html>`_
    we switch the backing SOAP library and different libraries have different
    locations for their transport and cookiejar objects.
