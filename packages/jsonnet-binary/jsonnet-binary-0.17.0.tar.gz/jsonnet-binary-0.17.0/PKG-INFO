Description: # jsonnetbin
        An **unofficial** Python interface to [Jsonnet](https://github.com/google/jsonnet).
        
        This package is created to provide binary wheels and support all major platforms (Linux, Windows, and macOS) for Python 3.x. It ought to act as a drop-in replacement for the official package.
        
        For production builds, I *highly* recommend the [official package](https://pypi.org/project/jsonnet/).
