# Shortcuts for Python

Why I create sc4py? To avoid code's copy and paste. This are a many of code shortcuts  that I used many times.


## Date and time

* today - today date
* now - date and time of this moment
* now_str - date and time of this moment formatted as "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S"
* this_month - this month (a integer from 1 to 12)
* others_months - a list of all monthts (a integer from 1 to 12), except this month


## Env

* env - the value of a environment variable as String
* env_as_list - the value of a environment variable as List, comma is the default separator
* env_as_list_of_maps - the value of a environment variable as List of Maps, comma is the default separator of maps
* env_as_bool - the value of a environment variable as Boolean
* env_as_int - the value of a environment variable as Integer
* env_from_json - the value of a environment variable Python structure (lists and maps) considering the env as JSON


## Class manipulation

* instantiate_class


## Number

* percentage - Percentage of num2 of num1 width fixed precision (default 2)


## String 

* str2bool - Cast 'true', 'verdade', 'yes', 'sim', 't', 'v', 'y', 's', '1', 'false', 'falso', 'no', 'nao', 'n√£o', 'f', 'n' and '0' to Boolean


## ZIP

* unzip_content - unzip the specified (first by default) file in a 'in memory' zip
