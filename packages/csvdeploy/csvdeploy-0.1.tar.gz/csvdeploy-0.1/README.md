# csvdeploy

Python package for deploying tabular data files (csvw) as static websites with continuous integration

## Introduction

`csvdeploy` is a Python library for the generation and deployment of static websites
based on tabular data following [csvw](the https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/) standard
from W3C. It intended as a solution for simple websites requiring almost no configuration and
which can be served on cheap or free hosting services: out goal is to have a tool that is
as "plug-and-play" as possible, and which can be configured for continuous integration.
Simple things should be simple, and hard things should be possible -- as long as they
don't steep the learning curve.

## Installation and usage

The library can be installed as any standard Python library with `pip`, as in the snippet
below. If installed in a local machine, it is highly recommended using a virtual
environment solution. In all cases, updating the packages used for installing libraries
is also recommended whenever possible (that is, `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`).

```bash
$ pip install deploycsv
```

In most situations, however, you will probably want to use the library automatically in
some integrated system. The intended usage is to have a `git` repository holding
your data that will automatically invoke `csvdeploy`, generate the new web pages, and
upload them to be served each time the raw data is changed. The instructions for
installing and using the library will depend on the exact system you will be using,
with the most common given in our documentation.

The basic operation is to invoke the `csvdeploy` command-line tool, pointing it to
a JSON configuration file, as in the command below using one the demo datasets
distributed with the package:

```bash
$ csvdeploy demo_data/langgenera/langgenera.config.json
```

The exact operation of the tool will, as expected, depend on the configuration. By
default, a new site will be generated in the `_site` directory under the path where
it is called.
