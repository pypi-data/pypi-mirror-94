```mlots``` provides Machine Learning tools for Time-Series Classification.
This package builds on (and hence depends on) ```scikit-learn```, ```numpy```, ```tslearn```, ```annoy```, and ```hnswlib``` libraries.

It can be installed as a python package from the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mlots/) repository.

## Installation

Install ```mlots``` by running:

   <pre><code class="python">pip install mlots
</code></pre>

After installation, it can be imported to a ```python``` environment to be employed.

   <pre><code class="python">import mlots
</code></pre>
