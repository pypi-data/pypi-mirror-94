updated you may have to wait a few minutes for the backing software images to be
rebuilt.*

## About

The [pywwt] package is the official toolkit for visualizing astronomical data in
Python using [AAS][aas] [WorldWide Telescope][wwt] (WWT). WWT is a free,
open-source tool for visually exploring humanityâ€™s scientific understanding of
the Universe. It includes a sophisticated 4D WebGL rendering engine and a
cloud-based web service for sharing and visualizing terabytes of astronomical
data. WWT is brought to you by the non-profit [American Astronomical Society][aas]
(AAS), the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, and
the [.NET Foundation][dnf].

With [pywwt] you can:

* Visualize and explore astronomical data interactively in the [Jupyter and
  JupyterLab][jupyter] environments through an HTML widget
* Do the same in standalone applications with a [Qt][qt] widget
* Load data from common astronomical data formats (e.g. [AstroPy
  tables][tables]) into WWT
* Control a running instance of the WWT Windows application
