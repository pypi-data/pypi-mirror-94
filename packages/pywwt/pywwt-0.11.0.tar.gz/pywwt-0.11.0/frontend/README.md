# The pywwt Frontend Module

This NPM package contains the JavaScript code implementing the frontend of the
[pywwt] data visualization tool, as used in [Jupyter/JupyterLab][jupyter]. For
more information, see [the pywwt docs][pywwt]. As such, this package is mostly a
pywwt implementation detail. To write your own WWT-based web apps, check out
[documentation for the WWT web stack][web-docs].

pywwt is built on the [AAS][aas] [WorldWide Telescope][wwt] (WWT) system. WWT is
a free, open-source tool for visually exploring humanityâ€™s scientific
understanding of the Universe. WWT is brought to you by the non-profit [American
Astronomical Society][aas] (AAS), the major organization of professional
astronomers in North America, and the [.NET Foundation][dnf].
