# ===========================================================

#
# The format of this file is simply one of 'key value' lines.
# Lines containing only whitespace at the beginning and then a # are ignored
# as comments. But comments can NOT be put on lines with data.

# This part is taken from the eelslab code of Fran.
# Many of the values are not used
# The meaning and use of each key are explained below.

# Default microscope as defined in the file microscopes.csv. This file can
# be edited with any spreadsheet programme of with a text editor. Its default
# location in ~/.quantifit in Linux (and other UNIXES) and %APPDATA/eelslab in 
# windows.
microscope Libra 200

# Default path for the GATAN GOS files. If 'None' EELSLab will try to find
# the files in the standard locations ( GATAN tree for windows, ~/.eelslab
# folder in UNIXes. If it fails, it will exit and ask to define the path in
# this file.
GOS_dir None 

# Default fine structure width in eV. This defines the exclude after in the FIT
fs_emax 30

# Certain calculations, i.e. fitting the background, requiere removing the
# edges from the experimental data. For that the values of the edge onset
# minus the preedge_safe_window_width will be used. In eV.
preedge_safe_window_width 5

# NOT USED BY QUANTIFIT FROM HERE ON

# Wether the fine structure is activated by default. Choose 1 or 0 ( True or False)
fs_state 1

# The fine structure fingerprinting is done by interpolating a given number
# of knots with a third order spline. The knots factor is defined as
# (number of knots) / (number of channels).
knots_factor 0.3

# 
min_distance_between_edges_for_fine_structure 0.

# Default fitter.
fitter leastsq

# Default file format
file_format nc

# Syncronize the core loss alignment and energy origin with the low loss.
# It is interesting for dual EELS cameras. Choose 1 or 0 ( True or False)
synchronize_cl_with_ll 0

# If 1 the object will be plot when loaded.
plot_on_load 0
