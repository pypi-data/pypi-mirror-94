"""
Smith-Wilson extrapolation with various alphas
==============================================

This notebook reads in the **smithwilson** model,
and extrapolates forward rates
using the Smith-Wilson method with various alphas, and draws
the forward rates.
See :doc:`/projects/smithwilson` for the details of the **smithwilson** model.

The source of the input data is Switzerland EIOPA spot rates
with LLP 25 years available from the following source.
