LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
**lifelib** is a collection of actuarial projection models.
lifelib models are built as `modelx`_ models, ready to be used out of the box
with sample formulas and input files, and they are
fully customizable by users.

.. _modelx: http://docs.modelx.io

Feature highlights
------------------

    - Formulas and their calculated values paired as **Cells**,
      just like spreadsheet cells
    - Relevant cells grouped together as a **Space**, just like a spreadsheet
    - Spaces in other spaces (subspaces), forming trees of spaces
    - **Models** composed of spaces
    - Space inheritance
    - Parametrized dynamic subspaces created automatically
    - Saving to / loading from files
    - Conversion to Pandas objects
    - Reading data from Excel files
    - Cells graph to track cells interdependency

Why **lifelib**?
----------------

    - Better model integrity and extensibility
    - For readable formula expressions
    - For eliminating spreadsheet errors
    - For better version control/model governance

What for?
---------

    - Pricing / Profit testing
    - Model validation / testing
    - Prototyping for production models
    - As corporate models
    - For simulations
    - As replacement for any spreadsheet models
