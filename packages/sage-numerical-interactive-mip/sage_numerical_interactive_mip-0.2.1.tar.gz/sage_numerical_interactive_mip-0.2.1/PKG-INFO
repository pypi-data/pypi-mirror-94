        .. intro
        
        This package is an extension of SageMath's mixed integer linear programming
        facilities described at
        http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/numerical/index.html
        
        It was written by Peijun Xiao, Zeyi Wang, and Yuan Zhou in 2015-2016 at UC Davis
        for integration into SageMath.
        
        Parts of their work (improvements to
        ``sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method`` and MIP backend methods)
        that required changes to existing SageMath modules have already been
        integrated into SageMath in various tickets, see meta-ticket
        https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20302 (“Interactions with
        ``InteractiveLinearProgram`` and its dictionaries”).  The present
        package should run on any recent release of SageMath.
        
        The module ``sage_numerical_interactive_mip.interactive_milp_problem``,
        written by Peijun Xiao, provides the interactive MILP problem classes,
        MILP tableau classes, and the cutting plane method. It is based on
        commit 5a4e3508d95e95e4491efcb2cf16fbe25be60bec, dated August 24, 2016,
        from the SageMath tree https://github.com/pgxiao/cutting-plane-method; 
        this work superseded an earlier effort (adding integer variables in
        ``interactive_simplex_method``) at
        https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18805
        
        The modules ``sage_numerical_interactive_mip.clean_dictionary`` and
        ``sage_numerical_interactive_mip.backends.*_backend_dictionary``,
        written by Zeyi (Aedi) Wang, provide a textbook view on a simplex basis
        in a numerical solver. They are based on
        https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18804
        
        The branches were rebased by Matthias Koeppe in January 2020 onto
        SageMath version 9.1.beta1, then filtered using ``git filter-repo`` and
        merged.
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        This needs a working SageMath; install, for example, from conda-forge as
        described in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html
        
        The code comes with extensive documentation and tests; see the
        docstrings in the modules.
        
        How to run the testsuite and build the HTML documentation
        =========================================================
        
        Install ``tox``, make sure that ``sage`` is accessible in your ``PATH``
        and then run ``tox``.
        
        This also builds the documentation in ``.tox/docs/tmp/html/index.html``.
