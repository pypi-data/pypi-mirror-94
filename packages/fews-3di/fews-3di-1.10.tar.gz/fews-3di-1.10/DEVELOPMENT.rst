Development instructions
========================


Development installation
------------------------

We use python's build-in "virtualenv" to get a nice isolated directory. You
only need to run this once::

  $ python3 -m venv .

A virtualenv puts its commands in the ``bin`` directory. So ``bin/pip``,
``bin/pytest``, etc. Set up the dependencies like this::

  $ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

There will be a script you can run like this::

  $ bin/run-fews-3di

It runs the ``main()`` function in ``fews-3di/scripts.py``, adjust that if
necessary. The script is configured in ``setup.py`` (see ``entry_points``).

If you need a new dependency (like ``requests``), add it in ``setup.py`` in
``install_requires``. Local development tools, like "black", can be added to
the ``requirements.txt`` file. In both cases, run install again to actuall
install your dependency::

  $ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt


Code structure
--------------

- ``fews_3di/scripts.py``: the ``run-fews-3di`` code. Should only handle the
  commandline stuff and logging setup.

- ``fews_3di/simulation.py``: the main ``ThreediSimulation`` class. The
  various steps like "add rain" and "start simulation" are separate methods on
  that class: this way you can ceep the overview of what's happening. It is a
  class to make it easier to share common data like "simulation id".

- ``fews_3di/utils.py``: reading the settings plus some helper functions like
  ``timestamps_from_netcdf()``.

- ``fews_3di/tests/*``: the tests, including sample data.


Error handling and logging
--------------------------

Try/excepts are only used when strictly necessary. Unexpected errors will
simply be shown as a traceback.

Some errors are expected, like a missing setting or a missing netcdf file. For
these, there's an explicit error class like ``MissingSettingException``. These
are caught in ``scripts.py`` and shown as a neat error message. With
``--verbose``, you also get the traceback.

Debug logging is used to make it easy to figure out what the program is doing
in case of a problem or an unexpected result.

Info level logging is for feedback to the user. Don't log too much on this
level.

Warning/error are the usual. An error when something is wrong and we're
stopping the script. A warning for when something *seems* wrong, but when
we'll continue execution anyway.



Neatness and tests
------------------

In order to get nicely formatted python files without having to spend manual
work on it, run the following command periodically::

  $ make beautiful

If you don't have "make" installed, look in the Makefile for the commands it
runs (black, flake8, isort).

Run the tests regularly. This also checks with pyflakes, black and it reports
coverage. Pure luxury::

  $ bin/pytest --disable-warnings

The tests are also run automatically `on "github actions"
<https://github.com/nens/fews-3di/actions>`_ for
"master" and for pull requests. So don't just make a branch, but turn it into
a pull request right away:

- **Important**: it is easy to give feedback on pull requests. Little comments
  on the individual lines, for instance. So use it to get early feedback, if
  you think that's useful.

- On your pull request page, you also automatically get the feedback from the
  automated tests.

There's also
`coverage reporting <https://coveralls.io/github/nens/fews-3di>`_
on coveralls.io.

As an **experiment**, python type hints are sprinkled throughout the
code. When running the tests, errors are often found. The reason for the
experiment was some confusion in the original version of fews-3di:

- A string "True" from the settings instead of a proper boolean True/False
  value.

- Timestamps that were sometimes datetime objects and sometimes iso-formatted
  datetime strings.

With type hints, it is perfectly clear what something is supposed to be.


Releases
--------

Before releasing, make sure the changelog is up to date, otherwise
zest.releaser complains :-) Then run fullrelease::

  $ bin/fullrelease

Github detects the new tag and automatically uploads a new release to
https://pypi.org/project/fews-3di/
