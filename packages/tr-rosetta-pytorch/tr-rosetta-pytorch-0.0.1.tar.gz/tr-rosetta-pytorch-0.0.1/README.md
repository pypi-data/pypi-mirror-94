## trRosetta - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of trRosetta and trDesign for Pytorch, made into a convenient package, for protein structure prediction and design. Will also contain an experimental version of trRosetta that uses <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/bottleneck-transformer-pytorch">Bottleneck Transformers</a>.
