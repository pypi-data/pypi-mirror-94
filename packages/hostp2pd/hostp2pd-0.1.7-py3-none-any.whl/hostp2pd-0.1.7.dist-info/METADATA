__The Wi-Fi Direct Session Manager__

*hostp2pd* implements a soft host [Access Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point) (AP) software in [Wi-Fi Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct) mode, enabling a [wireless network interface card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network_interface_controller) to act as *Ad hoc* access point and [Wi-Fi Protected Setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup) (WPS) [authentication server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication_server). It features basic functionalities roughly similar to [hostapd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostapd) (with its [hostapd.conf](https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/hostapd/hostapd.conf) configuration file), which is the common AP software integrated with *wpa_supplicant*, generally used for [infrastructure mode networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)#Infrastructure_mode). When implementing a [P2P persistent group](https://praneethwifi.in/2019/11/23/p2p-group-formation-procedure-persistent-method/), [wpa_supplicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wpa_supplicant) offers the [P2P-GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN#Peer-to-peer) features enabled by *hostp2pd* to connect P2P Clients like Android smartphones, as well as provide the standard infrastructure AP mode to the same P2P-GO group, without the need of *hostapd*.

In order to accept [Wi-Fi Direct](https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-direct) connections from P2P Clients, to activate a local [P2P-GO](https://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/devel/p2p.html) (Wi-Fi Direct Group Owner) and to perform WPS authentication, *hostp2pd* fully relies on *wpa_supplicant*, interfacing it through the [wpa_cli](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/wpasupplicant/wpa_cli.8.en.html) command-line interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)): *wpa_cli* is run in background and [p2p commands](https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/wpa_supplicant/README-P2P) are piped via pseudo-tty communication, while events returned by *wpa_cli* are read and processed.

*hostp2pd* includes a command-line interface mode for monitoring and controlling; it can be executed as a batch or as a daemon and provides an API for integration into other Python programs.
