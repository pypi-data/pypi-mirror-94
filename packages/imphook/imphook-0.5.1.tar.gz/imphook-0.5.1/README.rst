imphook - Simple and clear import hooks for Python
==================================================

The ``imphook`` module allows to easily define per file type import
hooks, i.e. overload or extend import processing for particular file
types, without affecting processing of other file types, and at the
same time, while ensuring that new processing integrates as seamlessly
as possible with normal Python import rules.

Besides the Python-level API to install import hooks, the module also
provides command-line interface to run an existing Python script or
module with one or more import hooks preloaded (i.e. without modifying
existing script source code).

Some but not all things you can easily do using ``imphook`` (most
of these require additional modules to do the heavy lifting,
``imphook`` just allows to plug it seamlessly into the Python import
system):

* Override importing of (all or some) .py files, to support new
  syntax or semantics in them.
* Import files written using a DSL (domain-specific language)
  as if they were Python modules. E.g., config or data files.
* Import modules written in other language(s), assuming you have
  an interpreter(s) for them.
* Import binary files, e.g. Java or LLVM bytecode.

``imphook`` works both with new, lightweight legacy-free Python
API, as promoted by the `Pycopy <https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy>`_
Python dialect (the original source of the "easy import hooks" idea),
and CPython (the older, reference Python implementation), and with
other Python implementations which are CPython-compatible.

Quick Start
-----------

Make sure that you already installed ``imphook`` using::

    pip3 install -U imphook

Below is a complete example of an import hook module to load
``key = value`` style config files::

    import imphook

    def hook(modname, filename):
        with open(filename) as f:
            # Create a module object which will be the result of import.
            mod = type(imphook)(modname)
            for l in f:
                k, v = [x.strip() for x in l.split("=", 1)]
                setattr(mod, k, v)
            return mod

    imphook.add_import_hook(hook, (".conf",))

Save this as the ``mod_conf.py`` file, and add the two following
files to test it:

``example_settings.conf``::

    var1 = 123
    var2 = hello

``example_conf.py``::

    import example_settings as settings

    print(settings.var1)
    print(settings.var2)

Now run::

    python3 -m imphook -i mod_conf example_conf.py

As you can see, the ``example_conf.py`` is able to import
``example_settings.conf`` as if it were a normal Python module.

Besides copy-pasting the above and other examples, you can also
clone the Git repository of ``imphook``, which contains various
ready-to-use examples::

    git clone https://github.com/pfalcon/python-imphook


API to install hooks and hook structure
---------------------------------------

The API of the module consists of one function:
`imphook.add_import_hook(hook, ext_tuple)`. *hook* is a name of
hook function. *ext_tuple* is a tuple of file extensions
the hook function should handle (the leading dot should be included).
More often than not, you will want to handle just one extension,
so don't forget to use the usual Python syntax with a trailing
comma for 1-element tuple, e.g.: ``(".ext",)``. Python modules may
not contain a dot (``"."``) in their names (they are used to separate
subpackages), so the extension you register may contain multiple
dots, e.g. ``".foo.bar"``, with filename ``my_module.foo.bar``
matching it.

It is possible to call `imphook.add_import_hook(hook, ext_tuple)`
multiple times to install multiple hooks. The hooks are installed
in the stack-like fashion, the last installed will be called
first. It is possible to install multiple hooks for the same file
extension, and earlier installed hooks may still be called in this
case, because a hook function may skip processing a particular
file, and let other hooks to take a chance, with default processing
happening if no hook handled the import.

The signature and template of the actual hook function is::

    def my_hook(modname, filename):
        # Return None if you don't want to handle `filename`.
        # Otherwise, load `filename`, create a Python module object,
        # with name `modname`, populate it based on the loaded file
        # contents, and return it.

The *modname* parameter is a full module name of the module to
import, in the usual dot-separated notation, e.g. ``my_module``
or ``pkg.subp.mod``. For relative imports originated from within
a package, this name is already resolved to full absolute name.
The *modname* should be used to create a module object with the
given name.

The *filename* parameter is a full pathname (with extension) of the
file which hook should import. This filename is known to exist, so
you may proceed to open it directly. You may skip processing this
file by returning ``None`` from the hook, then other hooks may be
tried, and default processing happens otherwise (e.g. ``.py`` files
are loaded as usual, or ImportError raised for non-standard
extensions). For package imports, the value of *filename* ends with
``/__init__.py``, and that is the way to distinguish module vs
package imports.

If the hook proceeds with the file, it should load it by whatever
means suitable for the file type. File types which are not natively
supported by Python would require installing and using other extension
modules (beyond ``imphook``). After loading the file, the hook should
create an empty Python module object which will be the result of the
import. There are a few ways to do that:

* The baseline is to call a module type as a constructor. To get
  a module type, just apply the usual ``type()`` function to an
  existing (imported) module. You'll definitely have ``imphook``
  itself imported, which leads us to::

    mod = type(imphook)(modname)

  The parameter to constructor is the name of module to create,
  as passed to the hook.
* If the above looks too magic for you, you can import symbolic
  name for module type from the ``types`` module::

    from types import ModuleType
    mod = ModuleType(modname)

* Finally, you may use the ``imp`` module, which may be as well
  the clearest (to the newbie) way of doing it::

    import imp
    mod = imp.new_module(modname)

  But mind that the ``imp`` module is considered deprecated.

Of the choices above, the first is the most efficient - no need
to import additional modules, and it's just one line. And once
you saw and were explained what it does, it shouldn't be a problem
to remember and recognize it later.

Once the module object is created as discussed above, you should
populate it. A way to do that is by using ``setattr()`` builtin
to set a particular attribute of a module to a particular value.
Attributes usually represent variables with data values, but
may be also functions and classes.

Finally, you just return the populated module object.

In case you want to perform custom transformation on the Python
source, the process is usually somewhat different, where you
transform a representation of the source, and then execute it
in the context of a new module, which causes it to be populated.
