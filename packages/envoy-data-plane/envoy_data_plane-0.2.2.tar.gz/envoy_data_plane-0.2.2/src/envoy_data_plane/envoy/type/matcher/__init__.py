    complete execution in linear time as well as limit the amount of memory
    used. Envoy supports program size checking via runtime. The runtime keys
    `re2.max_program_size.error_level` and `re2.max_program_size.warn_level`
    can be set to integers as the maximum program size or complexity that a
    compiled regex can have before an exception is thrown or a warning is
    logged, respectively. `re2.max_program_size.error_level` defaults to 100,
    and `re2.max_program_size.warn_level` has no default if unset (will not
    check/log a warning). Envoy emits two stats for tracking the program size
    of regexes: the histogram `re2.program_size`, which records the program
    size, and the counter `re2.exceeded_warn_level`, which is incremented each
    time the program size exceeds the warn level threshold.
