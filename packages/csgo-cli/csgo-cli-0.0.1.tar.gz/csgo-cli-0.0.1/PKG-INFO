        ![](src/csgo_connect.png)
        
        # Current installation
        ```
        pip install csgo-cli
        ```
        
        
        # Setup path to steam user data
        
        Steam stores your favorite servers in a file called `serverbrowser_hist.vdf`. 
        
        For me, this file was located at:
        ```/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/userdata/160616678/7/remote/serverbrowser_hist.vdf"```.
        
        ![](src/csgo_configure.png)
        
        When the `serverbrowser_hist.vdf` has been located, run: 
        ```
        csgo configure {full_path_to_`serverbrowser_hist.vdf`}
        ```
        
        Everything should now be set, enjoy!
