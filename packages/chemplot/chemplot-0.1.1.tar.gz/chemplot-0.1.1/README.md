# ChemPlot

In the last decades, Machine Learning (ML) applications have had a great
impact on molecular and material science. However, every ML model
requires a definition of its applicability domain. Chemplot is a python
library for chemical space visualization that allows users to plot the
chemical space of their datasets. Chemplot contains smart algorithms
behind which uses both structural and tailored similarity. Moreover, it
is easy to use even for non-experts.

## Installation

There two different options you can follow to install ChemPlot.

### Option 1: Use conda (recommended)

The easiest and recommended way to install is using conda. To install
ChemPlot, at the command line, run:

    conda install -c rdkit -c chemplot chemplot

### Option 2: Use pip

ChemPlot requires RDKit, which cannot be installed using pip. The
official RDKit installation documentation can be found
[here](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html).

After having installed RDKit, ChemPlot can be installed using pip by
running:

    pip install chemplot

## How to use ChemPlot

ChemPlot is a cheminformatics tool whose purpose is to visualize subsets
of the chemical space in two dimensions. It uses the [RDKit chemistry
framework](http://www.rdkit.org), the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) API and the
[umap-learn](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) API.

### Getting started

To demonstrate how to use the functions the library offers we will use a
BBBP (blood-brain barrier penetration) [1] molecular dataset. This is a
set of molecules encoded as SMILES, which have been assigned a binary
label according to their permeability properties. In this example the
dataset has been previously saved locally as a CSV file and is imported
with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html).

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
import pandas as pd
data_BBBP = pd.read_csv("BBBP.csv")
```

To visualize the molecules in 2D according to their similarity it is
first needed to construct a `Plotter` object. This is the class
containing all the functions ChemPlot uses to produce the desired
visualizations. A `Plotter` object can be constructed using
classmethods, which differentiate between the type of input that is feed
to the object. In our example we need to use the method from\_smiles. We
pass three parameters: the list of SMILES from the BBBP dataset, their
target values (the binary labels) and the target type (in this case “C”,
which stands for “Classification”).

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
import chemplot as cp
plotter = cp.Plotter.from_smiles(data_BBBP["smiles"], target=data_BBBP["target"], target_type="C")
```

### Plotting the results

When the `Plotter` object was constructed descriptors for each SMILES
were calculated, using the library
[mordred](http://mordred-descriptor.github.io/documentation/v0.1.0/introduction.html),
and then selected based on the target values. We can now plot the BBBP
dataset in 2D to visually analyze the data. This is done by reducing the
number of dimensions for each molecule from the number of descriptors
selected to only 2. ChemPlot uses three different algorithms in order to
achieve this. The first figure shows the results obtained by reducing
the dimensions of features by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [2].

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
cp.pca()
plt.show()
```

The second figure shows the results obtained by reducing the dimensions
of features by t-SNE [3].

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
cp.pca()
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/mcsorkun/ChemPlot/blob/main/images/gs_tsne.png)

The third figure shows the results obtained by reducing the dimensions
of features by UMAP [4].

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
cp.pca()
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/mcsorkun/ChemPlot/blob/main/images/gs_umap.png)

In each figure the molecules are coloured by class value.
