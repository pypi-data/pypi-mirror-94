# RMfuse

RMfuse provides access to your reMarkable Cloud files in the form of a
[FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) filesystem.  These files are
exposed either in their original format, or as PDF files that contain
your annotations.  This lets you manage files in the reMarkable Cloud
using the same tools you use on your local system.

## Installation

RMfuse requires Python 3.7 or later.  It also requires the FUSE3 library.
This should be available in most Linuxes (`libfuse3-3` in Debian-based
distributions) and BSDs.  RMfuse may work with
[macFuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/), but that is untested.  Windows
users may try [WinFuse](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfuse), also
untested.  Installation of RMfuse and its dependencies will likely
require the FUSE3 headers and a C build system (`libfuse3-dev` and
`build-essential` in Debian).

RMfuse can be installed with pip:
```
pip install rmfuse
```
Alternatively, you may clone this repository.
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for development, so once that
is installed you can run
```
poetry install
```

## Usage

RMfuse installs the script `rmfuse`.  The script takes a single argument,
the path at which the filesystem should be mounted.  This must be an
existing directory.  Any files within that directory will be hidden as
long as RMfuse is mounted.
```
mkdir ~/remarkable
rmfuse ~/remarkable
```
(If you installed with Poetry, you may need to run `poetry run rmfuse`.)

The first time RMfuse is run, it will need a _one-time code_ to get
access to your reMarkable Cloud account.  You will be prompted to get
that code from https://my.remarkable.com/connect/desktop, which may
require logging in to your reMarkable account.  RMfuse uses that code
to obtain tokens which it uses in the future to authenticate itself.

To unmount and halt RMfuse, use the `fusermount` command:
```
fusermount -u ~/remarkable
```

### Modes

RMfuse offers several modes to display your reMarkable Cloud files.  You
can choose the mode with the `-m` option.

`annot`: Displays all files in PDF format, with your annotations added.
This is the default mode.

`orig`: Displays the original file for ebooks and PDF files.  Notebooks
are rendered as PDF files, as in the `annot` mode.

`raw`: Displays all files as ZIP files, reflecting the underlying format
used by the reMarkable Cloud.  This may be useful when working with other
tools that expect files in this form.

`meta`: Displays metadata about the files in JSON format.  Only useful for
debugging.

RMfuse provides a special file named `.mode` in root directory.  When read,
this file gives the current mode.  Writing a valid mode to this file will
switch the mode RMfuse is in.  Additionally, writing `refresh` to this file
will cause RMfuse to refresh its information from the reMarkable Cloud.
(By default, this happens every five minutes.)
```
~/remarkable $ cat .mode
annot
~/remarkable $ ls
book.pdf        document.pdf    notebook.pdf
~/remarkable $ echo orig > .mode
~/remarkable $ ls
book.epub       document.pdf    notebook.pdf
```

### Capabilities

RMfuse allows reading of all files in the reMarkable Cloud.  Since reading
the file requires several HTTP requests, as well as local processing, reads
make take some time.  Running RMfuse in verbose mode (`-v` or `-vv`) will
display information about the actions underway.  The most recent file
accessed is cached, to improve performance.  More sophisticated caching
is planned for the future.

RMfuse does its best to provide accurate metadata for the files.  However,
the reMarkable Cloud provides only modification dates, so that is reported
for creation and access dates as well.  File sizes in `annot` mode are
only estimates until the file is read for the first time.  This metadata
is cached locally to improve responsiveness in the future.

Files can be renamed and moved within the RMfuse filesystem.  These changes
will be propagated to the reMarkable Cloud.  Changes to the file extension
will be ignored.

Deleting files from a RMfuse filesystem moves them into the reMarkable
Cloud's trash area.  These files are accessible in the `.trash` hidden
directory in the root of the file system.  Deleting files within the
`.trash` folder removes them from the reMarkable Cloud.  (_N.B._ It is
not known if this deletes the files from the cloud, or just hides them
from clients.)

EPUB and PDF files may be copied into the filesystem, and new directories
can be created.  These changes are uploaded to the reMarkable Cloud.
Copying other types of files into the RMfuse filesystem will fail silently
(unfortunately).  File extensions are ignored by RMfuse, and thus may
change when files are uploaded.  For instance, if `book.epub` is uploaded
and RMFuse is in `annot` mode, it will show up in the filesystem as
`book.pdf`.

Existing files cannot be edited; they appear in read-only mode. If you
want to edit the contents of a file, you will need to copy it to your
local filesystem, edit it, and then copy it back to the RMfuse filesystem.
This will cause annotations to be lost (in `orig` mode) or flattened into
the document itself (in `annot` mode).

## Known Limitations

- The file size for annotated files is just an estimate before the file
is first read.  This can confuse some tools which use the file size to
determine how much to read.  After reading the file once, the file size
will be correctly reported going forward; rerunning these tools a second
time is usually enough to get them working.

- RMfuse sometimes fails to authenticate with the reMarkable Cloud
servers when starting up.  Several failures are possible before success
is achieved.  It is currently unknown what triggers this problem.  RMfuse
does not handle this gracefully at present.

- Adding a file other than an EPUB or PDF silently fails.  RMfuse does
throw an error when it has been given an invalid file, but this comes
too late for FUSE to pass the error back to the caller.  RMfuse may be
able to throw an error earlier, based on the first bytes it receives;
this will be investigated in the future.

- RMfuse caches the most-recently accessed file in memory.  This is bad
for large files (too much memory used) and small files (we could cache
several files).  A more sophisticated caching system is planned.

## Libraries

RMfuse is powered by [rmcl](https://github.com/rschroll/rmcl), for accessing
the reMarkable Cloud, and by [rmrl](https://github.com/rschroll/rmrl), for
rendering annoated documents.  The early development of RMfuse can be found
in the [rmcl repository](https://github.com/rschroll/rmcl)
