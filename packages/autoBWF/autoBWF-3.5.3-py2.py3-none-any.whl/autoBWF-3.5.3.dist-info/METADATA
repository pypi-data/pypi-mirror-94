The purpose of `autoBWF` is to provide an alternative GUI for embedding internal metadata in WAVE audio files using the [Broadcast Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format) standard, FADGI [BWFMetaEdit](https://mediaarea.net/BWFMetaEdit), and [XMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform). 

Unlike the existing BWFMetaEdit GUI, autoBWF is extremely opinionated and will automatically generate metadata content based on file naming conventions, system metadata, and pre-configured repository defaults. In addition, it can copy metadata fields from a template file to avoid having to enter the same information multiple times for several master or derivative files of the same physical instantiation.


Also included are two command line programs to simplify the creation of derivative files. `autolame.py` is a wrapper for the `lame` MP3 encoder that automatically transfers Wave internal metadata to appropriate ID3v2 tags. `autosplice` is a wrapper that generates `sox` commands from an EDL-like text file to splice audio from multiple input files, while also providing means to do basic fade in/out and audio level compression.

For full installation, usage, and configuration information, please read the docs on [readthedocs.org](https://autobwf.readthedocs.io/en/release/).
