    A decorator retrying given operation, failing it when an exception shows up.

    Essentially this:

    >>> @retry(3, RuntimeError)
    >>> def do_op():
    >>>     .. do op ..

    Is a syntactic sugar for this:

    >>> for i in range(3):
    >>>     try:
    >>>         .. do op ..
    >>>         break
    >>>     except RuntimeError:
    >>>         pass

    :param times: maximum times to retry this operation. By default (None) retry until the world ends.
    :param exc_classes: exception classes that should be considered failure. By default.
        catches everything (Exception).
    :param on_failure: callable to call when it fails times times. Callable will be called
        with a single argument, exception instance that was raised last. That exception will
        be swallowed, unless swallow_exception is set to False
    :param swallow_exception: the last exception will be swallowed, unless this is set to False
