        A tool to format in a **very opinionated** way HTML, XML and text
        containing XML snippets.
        
        It satisfies a primary need: decrease the pain of diffing HTML/XML.
        
        For this reason `zpretty` formats the markup following these rules of
        thumb:
        
        - maximize the vertical space/decrease the line length
        - attributes should be sorted consistently
        - attribute sorting is first semantic and then alphabetic
        
        This tool understands the [TAL
        language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Attribute_Language) and
        has some features dedicated to it.
        
        This tool is not a linter! If you are looking for linters safe bets are
        [Tidy](http://www.html-tidy.org/) and
        [xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html).
        
        You may have parsing problems! `zpretty` will close for you some known
        self closing tags, like `input` and `img`, that are allowed to be open
        in HTML.
        
        `zpretty` is not clever enough to understand correctly valueless
        attributes! Some work is ongoing, but it works best with \"normal\"
        attributes.
        
        Lack of feature/slowness are a known issue. For the moment the
        development focused in having a working tool. So it works fast enough:
        less than a second to format a \~100k file. New features are planned and
        also huge perfomance boost can be easily obtained. Anyway `zpretty` is
        not your option for formatting large files (\> 1 MB).
        
        See [TODO section](#todo_section) to know what is forecast for the
        future.
        
        The source code and the issue tracker are hosted on
        [GitHub](https://github.com/collective/zpretty).
        
        # INSTALL
        
        The suggested instal method is using
        [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/):
        
            $ pip install zpretty
        
        The latest release of `zpretty` requires Python3. If you need to use
        Python2.7 use `zpretty` 0.9.x.
        
        # USAGE
        
        Basic usage:
        
            zpretty [-h] [--encoding ENCODING] [-i] [-x] [-z] [file ...]
        
            positional arguments:
              file                 The list of files to prettify (defaults to stdin)
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help           show this help message and exit
              --encoding ENCODING  The file encoding (defaults to utf8)
              -i, --inplace        Format files in place (overwrite existing file)
              -x, --xml            Threat the input file(s) as XML
              -z, --zcml           Threat the input file(s) as XML. Follow the ZCML
                                   styleguide
        
        Without parameters constraining the file type (e.g. [-x]{.title-ref},
        [-z]{.title-ref}, \...) `zpretty` will try to guess the right options
        for you.
        
        Example:
        
            zpretty hello_world.html
        
        # DEVELOP
        
            $ git clone ...
            $ cd zpretty
            $ make
        
        # RUNNING TESTS
        
            $ make test
        
        # TODO
        
        - [ ] Valueless attributes are not allowed in XML
        - [ ] Attributes are aligned in a strange way if previous sibling has no spaces
        - [ ] TBD: Style attributes should be multiline
