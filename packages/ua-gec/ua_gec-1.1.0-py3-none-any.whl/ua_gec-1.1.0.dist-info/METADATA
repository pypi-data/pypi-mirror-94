# UA-GEC: Grammatical Error Correction and Fluency Corpus for the Ukrainian Language

This package contains the UA-GEC data and code to work with it.


## Python library

There is a Python package that consists of the data and the code to work with it.

### Getting started

A simple way to install the package is by `pip`:

```
    $ pip install ua_gec==1.1
```

Alternatively, you can install it from source:

```
    $ cd python
    $ python setup.py develop
```


### Iterating through corpus

Once installed, you may get annotated documents from Python code:

```python

    >>> from ua_gec import Corpus
    >>> corpus = Corpus(partition="train")
    >>> for doc in corpus:
    ...     print(doc.source)
    ...     print(doc.target)
    ...     print(doc.annotated)
    ...     print(doc.meta.region)
```


### Working with annotations

[The docs are under construction]


## Train-test split

We expect users of the corpus train and tune their models on the train split
only (of course, you are free to further split it into train-dev or use
cross-validation). Use the test split for reporting scores of your final
models.  Never optimize on the test set. Do not tune hyperparameters on it. And
please, do not use it for model selection in any way.

The [Statistics](#statistics) for the per-split statistics.


## Annotation format

Annotated files are text file that use the following in-text annotation format:
`{error=>edit:::error_type=Tag}`, where `error` and `edit` stand for the text item before
and after correction, respectively, and `Tag` denotes an error category
(`Grammar`, `Spelling`, `Punctuation`, or `Fluency`).

Example of an annotated text:
```
    I {like=>likes:::error_type=Grammar} turtles.
```

An accompanying Python package, `ua_gec`, provides many tools for working with
annotated texts. See its documentation for details.


## Statistics

UA-GEC contains:

| Split | Documents | Sentences |  Tokens | Authors |
|:-----:|:---------:|----------:|--------:|:-------:|
| train | 851       | 18,225    | 285,247 | 416     |
|  test | 160       | 2,490     | 43,432  | 76      |
| TOTAL | 1,011     | 20,715    | 328,779 | 492     |

The corpus statistics can be generated by running a script from the Python
package (note that the `ua-gec` package must be installed first):

```
$ python ./python/ua_gec/stats.py
```
