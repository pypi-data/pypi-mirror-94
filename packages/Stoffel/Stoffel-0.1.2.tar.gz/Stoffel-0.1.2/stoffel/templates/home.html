<h1 class="ui header">Welcome to Stoffel!</h1>

<h3 class="ui header">Introduction</h4>
<p>
    Stoffel is a tool that lets you capture spreadsheet cells as a picture and send it to a presentation. 
    This tool was built to solve a pain financial modelers feel when they need to keep slide figures up-to-date with the most recent model ouptuts. 
    Without Stoffel, this means tedious, time-consuming copying and pasting from the model to the presentation any time number change. 
    With Stoffel, you can link the figures once and, with the click of a button, update the entire deck. 
</p>

<p>Stoffel currently only supports Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets as sources, and Microsoft Powerpoint/Google Slides as destinations, and will only work on Windows OS. </p>

<h3 class="ui header">Usage</h4>
<p>
    Stoffel lets you create projects and add connections to those projects. 
    When you click the "Run" button on a project page, it will run all the connections for that project. 
    Helper icons next to inputs will allow you to select the file or you can type in the path or ID yourself. 
</p>
<p>Be sure to "Save" the project before you run it. </p>
