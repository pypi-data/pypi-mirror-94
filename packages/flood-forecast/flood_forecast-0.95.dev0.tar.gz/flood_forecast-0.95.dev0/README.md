# Deep learning for time series forecasting
![Example image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoronaWhy/task-ts/master/images/Picture1.png)
Flow forecast repository is an open-source deep learning for time series library. It provides all the latest state of the art models (transformers, attention models, GRUs) and cutting edge concepts with easy to understand interpretability metrics, cloud provider integration, and serving capabilities. Currently [Task-TS from CoronaWhy](https://github.com/CoronaWhy/task-ts/wiki) primarily maintains this repository. Pull requests are welcome. Historically, this repository provided open source benchmark and codes for flash flood and river flow forecasting.

## Getting Started 

Using the library
1. Run `pip install flood-forecast`
2. Detailed info on training models can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow-forecast/wiki/Training-models).
3. Check out our [Confluence Documentation](https://flow-forecast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FF/overview)

**Models currently supported**

1. Vanilla LSTM: A basic LSTM that is suitable for multivariate time series forecasting and transfer learning. 
2. Full transformer: The full transformer with all 8 encoder and decoder blocks. Requires passing the target in at inference. 
3. Simple Multi-Head Attention: A simple multi-head attention block and linear embedding layers. Suitable for transfer learning.
4. Transformer with a linear decoder: A transformer with n-encoder blocks (this is tunable) and a linear decoder.
5. [DA-RNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02971): A well rounded model with which utilizes a LSTM + attention. 
6. [Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00235): 
7. Transformer XL:
8. Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting
9. [DeepAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110)

**Forthcoming Models**

We have a number of models we are planning on releasing soon. [Please check our project board for more info](https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow-forecast/projects/5)

## Historical River Flow Data  

### Task 1 Stream Flow Forecasting 
This task focuses on forecasting a stream's future flow/height (in either cfs or feet respectively) given factors such as current flow, temperature, and precipitation. In the future we plan on adding more variables that help with the stream flow prediction such as snow pack data and the surrounding soil moisture index. 

### Task 2 Flood severity forecasting
Task two focuses on predicting the severity of the flood based on the flood forecast, population information, and topography. Flood severity is defined based on several factors including the number of injuires, property damage, and crop damage.
