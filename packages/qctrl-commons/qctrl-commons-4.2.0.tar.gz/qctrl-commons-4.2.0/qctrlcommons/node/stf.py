class DiscretizeStf(CoreNode):
    r"""
    Creates a piecewise-constant function by discretizing a sampleable function.

    Use this function to create a piecewise-constant approximation to a sampleable
    function (obtained, for example, by filtering an initial
    piecewise-constant function).

    Parameters
    ----------
    stf : Stf
        The sampleable function :math:`v(t)` to discretize. The values of the
        function can have any shape. You can also provide a batch of
        functions, in which case the discretization is applied to each
        element of the batch.
    duration : float
        The duration :math:`\tau` over which discretization should be
        performed. The resulting piecewise-constant function has this
        duration.
    segments_count : int
        The number of segments :math:`N` in the resulting piecewise-constant
        function.
    samples_per_segment : int, optional
        The number of samples :math:`M` of the sampleable function to take when
        calculating the value of each segment in the discretization. Defaults
        to 1.
    name : str, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    TensorPwc
        The piecewise-constant function :math:`w(t)` obtained by discretizing
        the sampleable function (or batch of piecewise-constant functions, if
        you provided a batch of sampleable functions).

    Notes
    -----
    The resulting function :math:`w(t)` is piecewise-constant with :math:`N`
    segments, meaning it has segment values :math:`\{w_n\}` such that
    :math:`w(t)=w_n` for :math:`t_{n-1}\leq t\leq t_n`, where :math:`t_n= n \tau/N`.

    Each segment value :math:`w_n` is the average of samples of :math:`v(t)`
    at the midpoints of :math:`M` equally sized subsegments between
    :math:`t_{n-1}` and :math:`t_n`:

    .. math::
        w_n = \frac{1}{M}

class ConvolvePwc(CoreNode):

    Creates the convolution of a piecewise-constant function with a kernel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pwc : TensorPwc
        The piecewise-constant function :math:`\alpha(t)` to convolve. You
        can provide a batch of functions, in which case the convolution is
        applied to each element of the batch.
    kernel_integral : Function
        The node representing the function that computes the integral of the
        kernel :math:`K(t)`.

    Returns
    -------
    Stf
        The sampleable function representing the signal :math:`(\alpha * K)(t)`
        (or batch of signals, if you provide a batch of functions).

    Notes
    -----
    The convolution is

    .. math::
        (\alpha * K)(t) \equiv
        \int_{-\infty}^\infty \alpha(\tau) K(t-\tau) d\tau.

    Convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the
    frequency domain, so this function can be viewed as applying a linear
    time-invariant filter (specified via its time domain kernel :math:`K(t)`)
    to :math:`\alpha(t)`.

class SincIntegralFunction(CoreNode):
    r"""
    Creates a function that computes the integral of the sinc function.

    Use this function to create a filter kernel that eliminates frequencies
    that are above a certain cut-off.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cut_off_frequency : float or Tensor
        Upper limit :math:`\omega_c` of the range of frequencies that you want
        to preserve. The filter eliminates components of the signal that have
        higher frequencies.

    Returns
    -------
    Function
        A node representing a function that computes the integral of the sinc
        function.

    Notes
    -----
    The range of frequencies that this kernel lets pass is
    :math:`[-\omega_c, \omega_c]`. After a Fourier transform to convert from
    frequency domain to time domain, this becomes:

    .. math::
        \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\omega_c}^{\omega_c} \mathrm{d}\omega
        e^{i \omega t} = \frac{\sin(\omega_c t)}{\pi t}.

class GaussianIntegralFunction(CoreNode):
    r"""
    Creates a function that computes the integral of a normalized Gaussian.

    Use this function to create a filter kernel that has a Gaussian shape. A
    Gaussian kernel lets pass frequencies in the range roughly determined
    by its width, and progressively suppresses components outside that
    range.

    Parameters
    ----------
    std : float or Tensor
        Standard deviation :math:`\sigma` of the Gaussian in the time domain.
        The standard deviation in the frequency domain is its inverse, so that
        a high value of this parameter lets fewer frequencies pass.
    offset : float or Tensor, optional
        Center :math:`\mu` of the Gaussian distribution in the time domain.
        Use this to offset the signal in time. Defaults to 0.

    Returns
    -------
    Function
        A node representing a function that computes the integral of the
        Gaussian function.

    Notes
    -----
    The Gaussian that this function integrates is normalized in the time
    domain:

    .. math::
        \frac{e^{-(t-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}.

    In the frequency domain, this Gaussian has standard deviation
    :math:`\omega_c= \sigma^{-1}`. The filter it represents therefore
    passes frequencies roughly in the range :math:`[-\omega_c, \omega_c]`.
