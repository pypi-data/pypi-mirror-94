    For all containers managed by podman, we'll create a systemd unit file
    so the containers automatically start at boot and restart at failure.
    When the container is removed, we'll disable and stop the service, then
    remove the systemd unit file.
    We prefix the SystemD service so we can identify them better.
    It will help to not conflict when rpms are installed on the host and
    have the same service name as their container name.
    For example haproxy rpm and haproxy container would have the same
    service name so the prefix will help to not having this conflict
    when removing the rpms during a cleanup by the operator.
