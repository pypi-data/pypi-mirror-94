# Neynpy
```Neynpy``` is a http library with Python interface. You can checkout [C](https://github.com/Neyn/cneyn) and [C++](https://github.com/Neyn/neynxx) interfaces too.

Since the project is new there are some limitations:

+ ```Windows``` platform isn't supported for now.
+ Partially implements [HTTP/1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) for now.
+ Uses some new features of ```Linux``` kernel so version 4.5 and above kernel is supported for now.
