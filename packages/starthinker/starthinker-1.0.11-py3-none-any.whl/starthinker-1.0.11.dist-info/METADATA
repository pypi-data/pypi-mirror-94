StarThinker is a Google gTech built python framework for creating and sharing re-usable workflow components. To make it easier for partners and clients to work with some of our advertsing solutions, the gTech team has open sourced this framework as a reference implementation.  Our goal is to make managing data workflows using Google Cloud as fast and re-usable as possible, allowing teams to focus on building advertising solutions.
