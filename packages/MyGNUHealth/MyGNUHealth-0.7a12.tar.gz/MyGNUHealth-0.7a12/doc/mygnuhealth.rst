The need of a Libre PHR
=======================
A Personal Health Record must respect the freedom of the individual.
We need to make sure that we are in charge of our health, and that the information
we store is private.

There are be different Health record applications in the market, but one of
the key benefits of MyGNUHealth is that is Libre. By Libre we mean that the source
code of the application is available; the user can modify it if she wishes, and
interact with the community to improve the application. 

MyGNUHealth is part of the GNU Health ecosystem, a social project that uses
technology to deliver Social Medicine, equity, freedom and privacy in healthcare.
