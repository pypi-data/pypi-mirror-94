Installation
============

.. warning::
    This software depends on a pulsar timing software package known as `Pint`,
    available through PyPI as `pint-pulsar`. Unfortunately, this software has
    the same import signature as the popular unit/quantity Python package also
    known as `Pint`, but available on PyPI as `pint`. Quantities and units are
    tracked in `PsrSigSim` and `pint-pulsar` using,
    `Astropy.units`. If you regularly use the quantity/units package `pint` in
    your workflow you will need to build a separate environment in order to use
    `PsrSigSim` and `pint-pulsar`.

.. warning::
    Additionally, `pint-pulsar` works with `astropy` to keep various
    clock/position files (such as IERS files)
    needed for pulsar timing up-to-date. It should be expected that the first
    time it is imported it will update these files if it has access to an
    internet connection.


Stable release
--------------

To install PsrSimSig, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install psrsigsim

This is the preferred method to install PsrSimSig, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Python installation guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/

If you have issues with the `fitsio` installation and you already have `cfitsio`
installed you may need to reinstall or `reconfigure`_ with different flags.

.. _reconfigure: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/c/c_user/node9.html

From sources
------------

The sources for PsrSimSig can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/PsrSigsim/PsrSigSim

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/PsrSigSim/PsrSigSim/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/PsrSigSim/PsrSigSim
.. _tarball: https://github.com/PsrSigSim/PsrSigSim/tarball/master
