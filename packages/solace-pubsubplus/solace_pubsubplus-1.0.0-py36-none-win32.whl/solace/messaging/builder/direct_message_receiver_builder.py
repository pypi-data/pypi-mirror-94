 This module contains builders for direct message receivers.
 Applications that need to receive direct messages must first create a  ``DirectMessageReceiverBuilder`` instance
 using the :py:meth:`solace.messaging.message_service.MessagingService.create_direct_message_receiver_builder()`

 The DirectMessageReceiverBuilder then creates one or more  DirectMessageReceiver as necessary.

        """
        Creates an instance of a direct message receiver
        (:py:class:`solace.messaging.receiver.direct_message_receiver.DirectMessageReceiver`).
        If the optional ``ShareName`` argument is given, the ``DirectMessageReceiver`` is implemented with Horizontal
        Scalability in mind. This method should be used when more then one
        instance of the application is running for horizontal scaling and messages are distributed
        by the PubSub+ event broker to all applications in the subscription group.
        When the ``ShareName`` argument is not specified, then the ``DirectMessageReceiver`` receives copies of all
        messages that match the configured subscriptions.  If multiple applications have the same subscriptions, then
        all matching messages are sent to all of the applications.

        Args:
            shared_subscription_group (ShareName): ShareName as the shared group name.

        Returns:
            DirectMessageReceiver: A direct message receiver object.
