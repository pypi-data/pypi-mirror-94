    An abstract class for asynchronous receiver subscriptions.

    All :py:class:`solace.messaging.receiver.message_receiver.MessageReceiver` classes support both synchronous
    (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) subscription operations.  This class defines the interface for
    asynchronous subscription operations.

        Makes a request to subscribe asynchronously to a given topic subscription.

        This method initiates the subscription process on the
        :py:class:`solace.messaging.receiver.message_receiver.MessageReceiver`.  The subscription request
        proceeds asynchronously, with the success or failure status available in the returned
        :py:class:`concurrent.futures.Future` object.

        Args:
            topic_subscription(TopicSubscription): The subscription expression to subscribe to. Messages with
                a topic that matches the subscription are  directed to this client.

            Future: An object used to determine when the connection attempt has completed.

        Makes a request to unsubscribe asynchronously from a given topic subscription.

        This method initiates the subscription removal process on the

        The unsubscribe request proceeds asynchronously, with the success or failure status available in the returned
        :py:class:`concurrent.futures.Future`. Once the process is complete, no more messages whose topic match the
        given subscription will be received in the
