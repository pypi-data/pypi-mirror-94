        Makes a request to subscribe synchronously to a given topic subscription.

        This definition performs the subscription operation on the

        proceeds are sent and the function blocks waiting for a response from the PubSub+ event broker.

            PubSubPlusClientError: When an operation could not be performed for some reason.
