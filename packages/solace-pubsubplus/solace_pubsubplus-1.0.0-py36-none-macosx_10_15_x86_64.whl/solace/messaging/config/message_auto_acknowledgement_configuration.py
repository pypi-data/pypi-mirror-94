This module defines the interface for enable message auto-acknowledgement. In some scenarios,
when a specific message is published, the receiver that has received that message and send an
acknowledgement for the message that was received back to the publisher. With auto-acknowledgement,
you can automatically acknowledge each message.

        Enables support for message auto acknowledgement (auto-ack) on all receiver methods,
        which includes both synchronous and asynchronous  methods.

        NOTE:
            - For callback-based methods, auto-ack is performed when the message-processing callback method
              is finished without an error. This means that if the message-processing callback method processes
              a message using another thread, the message acknowledgement may be performed before that other thread
              finishes and any errors raised in the other thread are not considered.

            - For blocking receive (without callback) methods: auto-ack is performed immediately after
              the :py:meth:`solace.messaging.receiver.persistent_message_receiver.receive_message()` call returns.
            - Should the underlying network connectivity fail auto acknowledgement may fail after the message-processing
              callback method. In this case it is not guaranteed to acknowledge messages automatically.
