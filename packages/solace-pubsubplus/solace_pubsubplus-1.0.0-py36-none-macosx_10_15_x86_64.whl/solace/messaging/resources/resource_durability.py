    An abstract class that abstracts a remote resource durability.

    PubSub+ event broker resources (queues and topic endpoints) may be durable or non-durable.
    A durable resource is a provisioned object on the event broker that has a lifespan independent
    of a particular client ``MessageService``.  They also survive an event broker restart and are
    preserved as part of the event broker configuration for backup and restoration purposes.
    A non-durable resource exists only so long as a ``MessageService`` is connected to the PubSub+ event broker.

        Determines if resource is durable. Durable endpoints are provisioned objects on the event
        broker that have a life span independent of a particular client session.

        Returns:
            bool: True if resource is durable, False otherwise.
