This module defines the interface for ``MissingResourceCreationStrategy``. When the
client attempts to create a ``MessageReceiver`` or ``MessagePublisher`` but the necessary
resources are not configured on the event broker, such as a Queue, then the ``MissingResourceCreationStrategy```
defines what remedial action the API may take.
