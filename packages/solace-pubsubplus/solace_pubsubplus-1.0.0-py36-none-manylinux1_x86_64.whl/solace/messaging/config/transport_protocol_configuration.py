        Sets the compression level for all messages sent as a messaging service.

        Args:
            compression_factor (int): Enables messages to be compressed with ZLIB before transmission
                and decompressed on receive. The valid  values to use are 0 (off) or 1..9, where 1 is
                least amount of compression (fastest) and 9 is the most amount of compression (slowest).
