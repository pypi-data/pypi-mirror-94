 This module contains a persistent message receiver builder.
 Applications that need to receive persistent messages must first create a ``PersistentMessageReceiverBuilder``
 instance using the the :py:meth:`MessagingService.create_persistent_message_receiver_builder()` method.

 The PersistentMessageReceiverBuilder then creates one or more ``PersistentMessageReceiver`` instances as necessary."""
