"""
This module contains the interface definition for messaging interoperability.

A Solace PubSub+ event broker supports many messaging protocols. When acting as a gateway
from one protocol to another, there may be messaging headers that need to be carried in
the messaging metadata.

One such protocol is REST. When you use the PubSub+ Messaging API for Python to receive messages that were
originally published by a REST publisher, it may be necessary to know the original HTTP content-type
or HTTP content-encoding which that is available for these interfaces.
