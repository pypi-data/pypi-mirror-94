        Applications can implement the ``PublisherReadinessListener`` interface and configure objects with this

            Makes a request to notify the application when the publisher is ready.

            This method helps to overcome a race condition between the completion of the exception
            processing and the :py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.message_publisher.MessagePublisher` instance,

        After a failure to publish due to
        :py:class:`solace.messaging.errors.pubsubplus_client_error.PublisherOverflowError`. The API
        will always call ``ready()`` when the Publisher Overflow condition has eased.  This can lead to race
        conditions and synchronization issues with the publisher thread, if the publisher thread is still processing
        the exception.

        Consequently, the publisher thread can always use :py:meth:`PublisherHealthCheck.notify_when_ready()`
        to request a ``ready()`` callback that is guaranteed to occur subsequent to the notify request.

            This ``ready()`` method is executed on a thread separate from the publisher thread.
