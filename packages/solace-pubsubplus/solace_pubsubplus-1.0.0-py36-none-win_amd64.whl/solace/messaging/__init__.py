Solace PubSub+ Messaging API for Python

This package contains a full-featured Python API for developing Python applications.  The API follows
the builder pattern.  Everything begins with a ``MessagingService.builder()`` call that returns a new
``MessagingServiceClientBuilder`` object.  When you use a ``MessagingService`` instance, applications can:

- configure the :py:class:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.MessagingService` object
- create a :py:class:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.MessagingService` object

The ``Messaging Service`` in turn can be used to:

- connect the :py:class:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.MessagingService`
- create a :py:class:`solace.messaging.builder.message_publisher_builder.MessagePublisherBuilder`:
  for building ``MessagePublishers``
- create a :py:class:`solace.messaging.builder.message_receiver_builder.MessageReceiverBuilder`
  for building ``MessageReceivers``
- create a :py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.outbound_message.OutboundMessageBuilder` for building ``Messages``
  to publish
