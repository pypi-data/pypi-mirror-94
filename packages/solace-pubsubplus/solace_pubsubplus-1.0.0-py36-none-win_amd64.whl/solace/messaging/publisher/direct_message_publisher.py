This module contains classes for direct message publishers.

A direct message publisher must be created using
:py:class:`solace.messaging.builder.direct_message_publisher_builder.DirectMessagePublisherBuilder`. The
DirectMessagePublisher instance is used to publish direct messages created by a
:py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.outbound_message.OutboundMessageBuilder`. The topic (or destination)
can be added when the message is a published.

The direct message publisher may also be use to publish simple messages containing only a bytearray or string payload.
