Module that contains Persistent Message Publisher.

A Persistent Message Publisher must be created by
:py:class:`solace.messaging.builder.persistent_message_publisher_builder.PersistentMessagePublisherBuilder`. The
``PersistentMessagePublisher`` instance is used to publish Guaranteed Messages created by a
:py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.outbound_message.OutboundMessageBuilder`. The
Topic (or destination) can be added once the message is a published.

The persistent message publisher can also be used to publish simple messages containing only a bytearray or
string payload.

    A class that defines the interface to a publisher for persistent messages.

        Message correlation tokens are used to PublishReceipt.
