"""
 This module contains a builder for direct message publishers.
 Applications that need to publish direct messages must first create a  ``DirectMessagePublisherBuilder``
 using the :py:meth:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.MessagingService.create_direct_message_publisher_builder()`.

 The ``DirectMessagePublisherBuilder`` then creates one or more ``DirectMessagePublisher`` instances as necessary.
