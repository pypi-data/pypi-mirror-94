configured from a dictionary. Also known as the `application_id`, it is preferable for applications to set NAME as
an argument to :py:meth:`solace.messaging.messaging_service.MessagingServiceClientBuilder.build()`.

If NAME is not specified, and `application_id` is not set, then an `application_id` is automatically generated.
