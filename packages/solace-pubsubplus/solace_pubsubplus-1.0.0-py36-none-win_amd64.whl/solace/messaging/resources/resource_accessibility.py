class ResourceAccessibility(ABC):
    """
    An abstract class that abstracts remote resource accessibility.

    PubSub+ Broker resources (queues and topic endpoints) can be accessed exclusively
    or non-exclusively.   A resource with exclusive accessibility can serve only one consumer at any one time,
    while additional consumers may be connected as standby. A resource with non-exclusive accessibility
    can serve multiple consumers and each consumer is serviced in a round‑robin fashion.

        """
        Determines if a remote resource supports exclusive or shared access mode.

        Returns:
            bool: True if a remote resource can serve only one consumer at any one time, False if a remote
            resource can serve multiple consumers; each consumer is serviced in round‑robin fashion.
