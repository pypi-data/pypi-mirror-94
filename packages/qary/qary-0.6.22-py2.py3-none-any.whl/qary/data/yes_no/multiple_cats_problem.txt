# state: Welcome

Bot: A woman went on vacation and asked a friend to look after her cat. A week later, 8 grown cats were living in the apartment.

Bot: Let's see how fast you can solve this mystery by asking me questions. The fewer questions you ask the better player you are. 

Bot: Remember: I can only answer with "yes" or "no". Or, sometimes. with "irrelevant". 

Bot: Let's play! Ready? 

Player: yes

Bot: Great! Ask me your first question. 

Bot: Remember: each question should bring you closer to solving the puzzle.

Bot: Yes. 

Player: Did he bring them all at once? 

Bot: Irrelevant

Player: Tbh, this is unfair. Why is it irrelevant? 

Bot: I'm sorry. Here is a tip: when one line  of enquiry reaches an end then another approach is needed, often from a completely new direction. This is where the lateral thinking in. This types of puzzles are also called lateral thinking puzzles

Player: Did he bring them for the lady to choose from?

replace the missing me. 

Bot: Please ask me a question. 

Player: Did the man bring other cats so that the lady could choose a cat to 
replace the missing one? 

Bot: No

Player: I don't understand 

Bot: This kind of puzzle teaches you to check your assumptions about any situation. You need to be open-minded, flexible and creative in your questioning and able to put lots of different clues and pieces of information together. Once you reach a viable solution you keep going in order to refine it or replace it with a better solution. This is lateral thinking! 

Player: Is it important what kind of cats they were?

Bot: Yes.

Player: Did he think that the lady would recognize her cat among these 8 cats? 

Bot: Yes.

Bot: Kudos! You solved it!

Bot: The next day this cat ran away, and the friend had to start looking for it. Since he did not know the cat very well, he had to keep all the similar cats that he had seen and wait for the friend who was supposed to identify the right pet.
