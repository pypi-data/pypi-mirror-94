## Contributions:
- Improve the platform
- Improve qa-bot
- Create new bots or improve existing ones
- Build on top of qary / integrate qary into your app (i.e. reddit integration, web-apps)

# Long term ideas:

Fake bot with scripted chats, hitting return at each line, typing then out with random pauses per letter, more for spaces,less for letters. Poisson.

B = Skill
Y = You

B: Good morning boss, what can I do for you?
--
- Y: I'm not sure. The news has got me down the past few days.
- Y: I'm feeling a little depressed
--
- B: last week Rattle and Hum cheered you up. I'll start playing  some energizing music while you work. You can tell me if it gets annoying.
- B: Yea, you aren't typing with the same enthusiasm you normally do. What's on your mind?
Y: I keep going over in my mind that conversation I had with my brother years ago.
B: Go on.
Y: And then that makes me think of how I'm not as successful as he is. And that keeps spiraling on and on into thoughts of dying alone.
B: wow that's a lot of stuff going on. Perhaps we can focus on one thing to improve today a little.
B: Is there something in particular this week or last night that triggered those thoughts?
Y: Perhaps it was those slides I have to put together for class.
How is that coming? Have you started on it?
Yea, I have a draft, but it's crap. It makea me look like a fool. It's full of mistakes. People will hate it.
Would you like me to help you try to improve it, or worried you rather we deal with some of the cognitive biases that are clouding your mind right now?
--
- Clouds
OK the first thing we need to do is give labels to your cognitive distortions so your brain can get better at sorting through your worries and anxieties better when they come to again today.
Do you remember some of the names you came up with for your favorite cognitive biases?
catastrophizing, mind reading, future proofing, over engineering
Good! Some of those might apply here. What about dichotomous thinking, do you remember that one?
