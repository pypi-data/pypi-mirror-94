Description: # Molmag AC GUI
        
        Import `process_ac` to use in scripts with your own data.
        
        Run the GUI with
        ```
        python -m molmag_ac_gui
        ```
        to use the GUI for fitting relaxation times. Your own file with data of (T, tau) can be loaded and fitted in the "Analysis"-tab
        when the file is formatted as
        
        ```
        T1 tau1
        T2 tau2
        T3 tau3
        
        ...
        ```
        
        v. 0.1.8:
        Removed a dependency on my own library of scientific constants and replaced with scipy.constants
        
        v. 0.1.9:
        Fixed import issue in importing process_ac
        
        v. 0.1.10:
        Fixed issue with loading ACMS data files (issue #4 on Github)
