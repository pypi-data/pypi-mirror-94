CouplingOperator:
  description: >
    Base template for a coupling operator that transforms outgoing firing rate of the pre-synaptic
    neural mass to incoming firing rate at the post-synaptic neural mass.
  base: OperatorTemplate
  equations: "L_CO * m_in = c * m_out"
  variables:
    L_CO:
      description: Linear differential operator
      default: 1

    m_in:
      description: Mean incoming firing rate at pre-synaptic terminal
      unit: 1/s
      default: output
    c:
      description:
        Connectivity constant that reflects connection strength
        from one neural population on another.
