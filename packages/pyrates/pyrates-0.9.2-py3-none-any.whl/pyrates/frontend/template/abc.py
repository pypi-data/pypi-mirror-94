        the resulting template is actually an instance of the class that this method was called from. This is done to
        ensure any cls.from_yaml() produces only instances of that class and not other classes for consistency.
        Templates are cached by path. Depending on the 'base' key of the yaml template,
        either a template class is instantiated or the function recursively loads base templates until it hits a known
        template class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path
            (str) path to YAML template of the form `path.to.template_file.template_name` or
            path/to/template_file/template_name.TemplateName. The dot notation refers to a path that can be found
            using python's import functionality. That means it needs to be a module (a folder containing an
            `__init__.py`) located in the Python path (e.g. the current working directory). The slash notation refers to
            a file in an absolute or relative path from the current working directory. In either case the second-to-last
            part refers to the filename without file extension and the last part refers to the template name.

        Returns
