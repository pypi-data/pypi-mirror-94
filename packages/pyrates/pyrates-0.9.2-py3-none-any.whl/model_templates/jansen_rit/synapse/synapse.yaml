RateToCurrentOperator:
  description: "Generic rate-to-current operator (RCO) to be replaced
    with a meaningful implementation. The CPO encodes the activation of
    synapses across the neural population due to pre-synaptic incoming
    firing rates. Activation leads to an electric mean electric current
    that contributes to the total membrane voltage change."
