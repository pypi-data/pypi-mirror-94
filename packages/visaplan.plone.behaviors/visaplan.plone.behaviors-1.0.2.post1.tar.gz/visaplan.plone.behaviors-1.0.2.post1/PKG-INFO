        visaplan.plone.behaviors
        ========================
        
        Interfaces and behaviors for a family of datatypes,
        based on zope.schema and Dexterity.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Interfaces / behaviors
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        IHeightAndWidth
                Provides the integer fields ``height`` and ``width``
        
        ICaptionAndLegend
                Provides the text fields ``caption`` and ``legend``
                (e.g. for image types)
        
        IExcludeFromSearch
                Provides a boolean field ``excludeFromSearch``, aimed for
                selective exclusion of objects from standard catalog searches
        
        IHierarchicalBuzzword
                **This is quite incomplete;**
                the provided ASCIILine field ``code`` is aimed for the implementation
                of a hierarchical buzzword index.
                The vocabulary is still to be implemented;
                the factory of this behavior will likely be (re-) implemented
                in another package.
        
        
        Examples
        --------

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Sorry, we don't have real user documentation yet.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package won't normally be installed on its own.
        Add it to the requirements of your package in which you intend to
        use one or more of its behaviors (in ``setup.py``)::
        
            setup(...
                install_requires=[
                    'setuptools',
                    ...
                    'visaplan.plone.behaviors',
                    ],
                ...)
        
        and add the behaviors you need to the list in the FTI file of your
        Dexterity-based type.
