# Test Dataset

## Truths

The *BGEN* files were converted into VCF format using the
[`bgenix`](https://bitbucket.org/gavinband/bgen/wiki/bgenix) tool in order to
get the truth values for the tests.


## Origin of test files

### `example.XXbits.bgen`

Those files were taken from the
[BGEN reference implementation](https://bitbucket.org/gavinband/bgen).


### `cohort1.bgen`

The file was extracted from the
[SNPTEST](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/snptest/snptest.html#download)
download.
