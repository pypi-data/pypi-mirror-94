        Ever felt the need to handle spammers in your discord, but don't have the time or effort to do so yourself? 
        This package aims to help solve that issue by handling all the required logic under the hood, as well as handling the spammers.

        How to use this right now?
        
        Download the codebase:
        ```
        > pip install Discord-Anti-Spam
        ```
        
        A basic bot
        ```python
        import discord
        from discord.ext import commands
        from AntiSpam import AntiSpamHandler
        
        intents = discord.Intents.default()
        bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)
        bot.handler = AntiSpamHandler(bot)
        
        @bot.event
        async def on_ready():
            print(f"-----\nLogged in as: {bot.user.name} : {bot.user.id}\n-----")
        
        @bot.event
        async def on_message(message):
            await bot.handler.propagate(message)
            await bot.process_commands(message)
        
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            bot.run("Bot Token")
        ```
        
        And that's it!
        Now, there will no doubt be bugs & changes etc. But, you can use this as is now and all I ask is you create an issue for anything you encounter while using this codebase.

        ### Build Ideology:
        - OOP approach 
        - Scalable -> Multi guild support out of the box
        - Test Driven -> CI with Github Actions
        
        Testing is done at python3.8 and above, due to the usage of `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` which
        is not available at lower python versions. The package itself however, should work with
        any version of discord.py rewrite and above.

        ### Discord
        
        Given the steady progress of this library I decided to create a discord.
        Come checkout the progress of the next release, give us ideas for what we should add, etc...
