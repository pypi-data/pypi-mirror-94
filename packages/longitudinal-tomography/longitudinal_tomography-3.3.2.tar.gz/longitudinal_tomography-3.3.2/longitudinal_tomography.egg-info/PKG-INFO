        INSTALL
        -------
        
        Clone the repository and run
        ::
        
           pip install .
        
        
        For development environments where it's preferable to compile the C++ extension inplace, it's possible to run the command
        ::
        
            python setup.py build_ext --inplace
        
        which will compile the C++ extension using the available compiler (decided by setuptools).
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        1. A gcc compiler with C++11 support (version greater than 4.8.4).  
        
        2. An Anaconda distribution (Python 3 recommended).
        
        3. That's all!
