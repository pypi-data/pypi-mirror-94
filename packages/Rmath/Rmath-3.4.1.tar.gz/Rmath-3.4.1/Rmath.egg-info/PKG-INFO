Description: Rmath-python
        ============
        
        This is the [standalone Rmath library from R][Rmath] for Python. It is based on
        the [Rmath-julia] library but does not alter the random number generation.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The package is available for pip installation:
        
            pip install Rmath
        
        Alternatively, you can clone or download this repository, and install from
        there in the usual way.
        
        In either case, a functional build system is required, but there are no
        dependencies.
        
        
        Updating the Library
        --------------------
        
        To update to the latest version of R, bump the `RVERSION` file, and run `make
        update`. Some additional manual changes to the headers may be necessary: these
        should go in `include/Rconfig.h`.
