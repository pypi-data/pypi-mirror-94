wpa_pyfi
========

wpa_pyfi provides a command line wrapper for iwlist and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
that makes it easier to connect the WiFi networks from the command line, specifically on a
a Raspberry Pi Device. The wpa_pyfi command is also implemented as a library that can be used from Python.
