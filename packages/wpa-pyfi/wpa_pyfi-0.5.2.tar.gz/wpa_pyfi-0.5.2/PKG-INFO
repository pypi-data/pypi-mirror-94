Description: wpa_pyfi
        ========
        
        wpa_pyfi provides a command line wrapper for iwlist and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
        that makes it easier to connect the WiFi networks from the command line, specifically on a
        a Raspberry Pi Device. The wpa_pyfi command is also implemented as a library that can be used from Python.
        
        ::
        
        $ pip install wpa_pyfi
        $ wpa_pyfi --help

        :release-date: 2021-02-10
        
        - There was an issue in 0.5.1 that prevented pip install. PyPi will not let me overwrite/remove it so it is being fixed in this release

        ^^^^^
        :release-date: 2021-02-03
        
        - Add automatic priority management so activated networks will connect (fix ambiguity bug)
        - Remove explicit priority specification on network creation
        - Fix parsing bug that would cause connection data retrieval to fail for network
        - Make NETNAME parameter optional in CLI arguments
