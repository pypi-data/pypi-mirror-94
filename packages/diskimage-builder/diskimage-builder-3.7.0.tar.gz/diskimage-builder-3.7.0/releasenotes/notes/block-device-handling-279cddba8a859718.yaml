features:
  - Add new block device handling.
    Unify and generalize the creation and usage of
    block device.  This release includes setting up the general
    infrastructure and setting up loop device

issues:
  - Because the implementation of the new block device layer is not
    complete, some features which are already implemented cannot be
    used because of limitations of the current environment.

deprecations:
  - The current way of handling block devices is deprecated. The
    existing block device phase will be called for a limited time.  If
    this phase delivers a result, this is used; if there is no result,
    the new way of block device handling is used.
    Please note that the old way of block device handling has some
    major limitations such as that it is only possible to use one
    block device.

  - The element 'partitioning-sfdisk' is deprecated.  The new
    implementation will create the partition tables based on a tool
    independent description.
