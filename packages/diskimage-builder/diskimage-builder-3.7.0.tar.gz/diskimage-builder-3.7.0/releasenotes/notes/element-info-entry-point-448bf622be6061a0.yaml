deprecations:

  - The ``element-info`` script is now provided by a standard python
    entry-point, rather than an explicit wrapper script.  This may
    affect you if you were running this script directly out of ``bin``
    in the source directory without installing.  See developer notes
    for details on using developer-installs with virtual environments
    for testing.
