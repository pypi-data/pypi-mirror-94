    Allow to configure debug per service.
    The feature is backward compatible with existing Debug parameter.
    Adding a new parameter per service, e.g. GlanceDebug. Set to False,
    it will disable debug for the service, even if Debug is set to True.
    If Debug is set to False but GlanceDebug is set to True, Glance debug
    will be enabled.
