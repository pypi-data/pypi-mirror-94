    Exclude /var/lib/ironic/* from container-puppet.sh rsync, this is a
    leftover from the initial containerization of TripleO; now we have
    host prep tasks, the ironic conductor and inspector bind mount
    /var/lib/ironic and generate the data that they need. But this data should
    not be in the config volume or it can conflict from each other when rsync
    runs at the same time. Check `launchpad bug 1868934
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1868934>`_.
    TripleO upgrade tasks and host prep tasks will take care of removing
    the var directory from the config volumes and the containers will just use
    the bind mount, like it should be doing now.
    These tasks will run during a minor update, major upgrade, and fast
    forward upgrade.
