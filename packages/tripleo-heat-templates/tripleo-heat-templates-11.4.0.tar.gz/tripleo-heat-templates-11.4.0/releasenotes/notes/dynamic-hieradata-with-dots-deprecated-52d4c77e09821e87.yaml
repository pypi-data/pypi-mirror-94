deprecations:
  - |
    The dynamic tripleo firewall_rules, haproxy_endpoints, haproxy_userlists
    that are configured with dots are deprecated with the update to puppet 5.
    They will no longer work and must be switched to the colon notation to
    continue to function. For example `tripleo.core.firewall_rules` must
    be converted to `tripleo::core::firewall_rules`.  Similarly the haproxy
    endpoints and userlists that are dynamic using dots must also be converted
    to use colons.
