    Add support for native TLS encryption on NBD for disk migration

    The NBD protocol previously runs in clear text, offering no security
    protection for the data transferred, unless it is tunnelled over some
    external transport like SSH. Such tunnelling is inefficient and
    inconvenient to manage. Support for TLS to the NBD clients & servers
    provided by QEMU was added. In tls-everywhere use case we want to
    take advantage of this feature to create the certificates and configure
    qemu to use nbd tls.
