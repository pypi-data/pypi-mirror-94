    Adds tags to roles that allow an operator to specify custom tags to use
    when trying to find functionality available from a role. Currently a role
    with both the 'primary' and 'controller' tag is consider to be the primary
    role.  Historically the role named 'Controller' was the 'primary' role and
    this primary designation is used to determine items like memcache ip
    addresses. If no roles have the both the 'primary' and 'controller' tags,
    the first role specified in the roles_data.yaml is used as the primary
    role.

    If using custom roles data, the logic was changed to leverage the first
    role listed in the roles_data.yaml file to be the primary role. This can
    be worked around by adding the 'primary' and 'controller' tags to the
    custom controller role in your roles_data.yaml to ensure that the defined
    custom controller role is still considered the primary role.
