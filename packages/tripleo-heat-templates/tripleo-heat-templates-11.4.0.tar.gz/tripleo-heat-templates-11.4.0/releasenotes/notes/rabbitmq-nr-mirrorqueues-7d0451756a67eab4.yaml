    We now set the default number of rabbitmq queues to CEIL(N/2).  (Where N is
    the number of rabbitmq nodes). Previously this was set to N by default
    which translated to having all queues mirrored to all controllers. By
    changing the default to CEIL(N/2) the queues will not be copied around all
    servers, but just to a subset of them. This still provides the necessary
    resilience in case of a controller crash, but is less demanding in terms of
    performance (and likely triggers fewer bugs in rabbit)
