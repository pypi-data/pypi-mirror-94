    The KeystoneNotificationTopics parameter was introduced. This takes a list
    which will configure extra notification topics, which end up as queues in
    the message broker. This is useful for when keystone notifications need to
    be integrated with third party software. Note that enabling telemetry will
    by default make keystone emit notifications to the 'notifications' topic, but
    this parameter can enable extra topics still.
