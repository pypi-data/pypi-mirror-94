    Support setting values for ``cephfs_volume_mode`` manila parameter via
    the THT parameter ManilaCephFSCephVolumeMode.  These control the POSIX
    rwx mode of the cephfs volumes, snapshots, and groups of these that back
    corresponding manila resources.  Default value for ManilaCephFSCephVolumeMode
    is '0755', backwards-compatible with the mode for these objects before it
    was settable.
