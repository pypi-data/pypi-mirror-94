    Non-lifecycle stack actions like stack check and cancel
    update for undercloud are now disabled. Stack check is
    yet to be migrated to heat convergence architecture
    and cancel update is not recommended for overcloud. Both
    are disabled by adding required heat policy for undercloud.
    'overcloud update abort' wrapper for stack cancel update
    had been dropped since few releases.
