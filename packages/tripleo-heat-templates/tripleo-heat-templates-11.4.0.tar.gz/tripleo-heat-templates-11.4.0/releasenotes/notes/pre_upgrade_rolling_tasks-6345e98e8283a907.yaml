    pre_upgrade_rolling_tasks are added for use by the composable
    service templates. The resulting
    pre_upgrade_rolling_steps_playbook is intended to be run at the
    beginning of major update workflow (before running the
    upgrade_steps_playbook). As the name suggests, the tasks in this
    playbook will be executed in a node-by-node rolling fashion.
