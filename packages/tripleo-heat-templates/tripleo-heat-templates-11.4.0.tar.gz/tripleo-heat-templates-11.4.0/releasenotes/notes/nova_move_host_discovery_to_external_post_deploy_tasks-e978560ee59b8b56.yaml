    Recent changes for e.g edge scenarios caused intended move of discovery
    from controller to bootstrap compute node. The task is triggered by
    deploy-identifier to make sure it gets run on any deploy,scale, ... run.
    If deploy run is triggered with --skip-deploy-identifier flag, discovery
    will not be triggered at and as result causing failures in previously
    supported scenarios.
    This change moves the host discovery task to be an ansible
    deploy_steps_tasks that it gets triggered even if --skip-deploy-identifier
    is used, or the compute bootstrap node is blacklisted.
