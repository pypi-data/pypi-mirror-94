    New roles for DistributedCompute and DistributedComputeHCI are added. These
    roles match the existing Compute roles, but also include the CinderVolume
    service. The CinderVolume service is included using the
    BlockStorageCinderVolume service name so that it can be mapped
    independently from CinderVolume.
