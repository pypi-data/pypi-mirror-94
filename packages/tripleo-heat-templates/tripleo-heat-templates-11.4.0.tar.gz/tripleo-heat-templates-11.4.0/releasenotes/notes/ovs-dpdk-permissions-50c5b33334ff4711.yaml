features:
  - Till now, the ovs service file and ovs-ctl command files are patched
    to allow ovs to run with qemu group. In order to remove this
    workarounds, a new group hugetlbfs is created which will be shared
    between ovs and qemu. Vhostuser Socket Directory is changed from
    "/var/run/openvswitch" to "/var/lib/vhost_sockets" to avoid modifying
    the directory access by packaged scripts. Use env file
    ovs-dpdk-permissions.yaml while deploying.
