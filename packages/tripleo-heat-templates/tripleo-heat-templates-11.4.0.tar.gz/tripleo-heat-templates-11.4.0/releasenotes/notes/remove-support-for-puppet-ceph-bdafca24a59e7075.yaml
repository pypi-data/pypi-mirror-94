    Deployment of a managed Ceph cluster using puppet-ceph
    is not supported from the Pike release. From the Queens
    release it is not supported to use puppet-ceph when
    configuring OpenStack with an external Ceph cluster.
    In Rocky any support file necessary for the deployment
    with puppet-ceph is removed completely.
