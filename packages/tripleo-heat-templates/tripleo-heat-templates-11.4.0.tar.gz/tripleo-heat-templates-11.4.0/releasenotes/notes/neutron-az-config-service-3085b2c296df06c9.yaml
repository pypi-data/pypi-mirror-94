    Neutron can be configured for using avaialabiity zones (AZs).

    .. note:: OVN does not normally run Neutron agents and also has yet support
      for AZ-aware routing scheduling. Therefore, no effective AZ configurations
      can be applied for the network services for the
      ``NeutronMechanismDrivers: ovn`` case.

    `NeutronDefaultAvailabilityZones`, `NeutronDhcpAgentAvailabilityZone`,
    `NeutronL3AgentAvailabilityZone`, `NeutronDhcpAgentsPerNetwork`,
    `NeutronNetworkSchedulerDriver`, `NeutronRouterSchedulerDriver` and
    `NeutronDhcpLoadType` can be used to configure various AZ configurations.

    By default, `Neutron*AvailabilityZone(s)` takes an empty value, which
    defines no AZs associated with the associated Neutron network service.

    .. note:: The empty AZ name cannot be re-defined via
      `Neutron*AvailabilityZone(s)` because of the empty value has been
      reserved for another purposes in t-h-t.
