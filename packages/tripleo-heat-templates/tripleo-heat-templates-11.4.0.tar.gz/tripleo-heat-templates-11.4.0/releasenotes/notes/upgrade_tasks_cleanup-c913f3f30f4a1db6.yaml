upgrade:

    We don't run the upgrade_tasks Ansible tasks that stop systemd services and
    since all services are now containerized.
    However, we decided to keep the tasks that remove the rpms in case some
    of deployments didn't cleanup them in previous releases, they can still
    do it now.
    These tasks were useful in Rocky when we converted the Undercloud from
    baremetal to containers but in Stein this is not useful anymore.
    It's actually breaking upgrades for Podman, as containers are now seen
    by systemd, and these tasks conflicts with the way containers are managed
    in Paunch.
