    Added NovaResumeGuestsStateOnHostBoot (true/false) parameter which
    configures whether or not to start again instances which were running at
    the time of a compute reboot.
    This will set the resume_guests_state_on_host_boot parameter in nova.conf
    and configures and enables libvirt-guests with a dependency to the
    docker service to shutdown instances before the docker container gets
    stopped.
    NovaResumeGuestsShutdownTimeout specifies the number in seconds for an
    instance to allow to shutdown.
