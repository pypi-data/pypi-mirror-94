    OVS and neutron now supports endpoint creation on IPv6 networks. New
    network-*-v6-all.j2.yaml environment files are added to allow tenant
    network to be created on IPv6 addresses. Note that these files are only
    to be used for new deployments and not during update or upgrade.
    network_data*.yaml files are also edited to reflect the same.
