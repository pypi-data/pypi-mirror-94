upgrade:
  - |
    The CIDR for the StorageNFS network in the sample network_data_ganesha.yaml file
    has been modified to provide more usable IPs for the corresponding Neutron
    overcloud StorageNFS provider network.  Since the CIDR of an existing network
    cannot be modified, deployments with existing StorageNFS networks should be
    sure to customize the StorageNFS network definition to use the same CIDR
    as that in their existing deployment in order to avoid a heat resource failure
    when updating or upgrading the overcloud.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed issue in the sample network_data_ganesha.yaml file where the
    IPv4 allocation range for the StorageNFS network occupies almost
    the whole of its CIDR.  If network_data_ganesha.yaml is used
    without modification in a customer deployment then there are too
    few IPs left over in its CIDR for use by the corresponding
    overcloud Neutron StorageNFS provider network for its overcloud
    DHCP service.
