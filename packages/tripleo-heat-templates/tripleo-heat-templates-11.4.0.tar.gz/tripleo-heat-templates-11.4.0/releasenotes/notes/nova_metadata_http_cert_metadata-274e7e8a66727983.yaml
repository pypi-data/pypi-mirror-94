    In case of cellv2 multicell environment nova-metadata is the only
    httpd managed service on the cell controller role. In case of
    tls-everywhere it is required that the cell controller host has
    ther needed metadata to be able to request the HTTP certificates.
    Otherwise the getcert request fails with "Insufficient 'add' privilege
    to add the entry 'krbprincipalname=HTTP/cell1-cellcontrol-0....'"
