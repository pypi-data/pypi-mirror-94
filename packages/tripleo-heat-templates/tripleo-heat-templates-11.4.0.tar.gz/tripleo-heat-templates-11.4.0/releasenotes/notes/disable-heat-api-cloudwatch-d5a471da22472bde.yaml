upgrade:
  - |
    The Heat API Cloudwatch API is deprecated in Pike and so it removed
    by default during the Ocata to Pike upgrade. If you wish to keep this
    service then you should use the environments/heat-api-cloudwatch.yaml
    environment file in the tripleo-heat-templates during the upgrade (note
    that this is migrated to running under httpd, if you do decide to keep
    this service on Pike).
deprecations:
  - |
    The Heat API Cloudwatch API is deprecated in Pike and so it is now not
    deployed by default. You can override this behaviour with the
    environments/heat-api-cloudwatch.yaml environment file in the
    tripleo-heat-templates.
