fixes:
  - The name_lower field in network_data.yaml can be used to
    define custom network names but the ServiceNetMap must be
    updated with the new names in all places.  This change
    adds a new field to network_data.yaml - service_net_map_replace,
    that should be set to the original name_lower so that ServiceNetMap
    will be automatically updated.
