features:

    It is no longer a requirement to provide the parameter:
    ``ControlPlaneSubnetCidr``  in the environment when deploying. Now
    ``get_attr`` on the server resource is used to resolve the value from the
    ``ctlplane`` subnet's ``cidr`` attribute. A conditional is used to
    determine if the user provided the parameter in the environment. If the
    user provided the parameter, the user provided value is used.
upgrade:
  - |
    Since the ``ControlPlaneSubnetCidr`` can now be resolved from the
    ``ctlplane`` subnet(s) this parameter can be removed from the environment
    (``network-environment.yaml``).

    .. Note:: Prior to removing the parameter, ensure that the property of
              the ``ctlplane`` subnet(s) is correct. In case it is not, update
              ``undercloud.conf`` with the correct configuration and re-run the
              ``openstack undercloud install`` command to ensure the property
              is set correctly.

    .. Note:: ``ControlPlaneSubnetCidr`` is now passed to the network config
              template when the resource is created. Because of this the
              parameter must be defined in the network config template, even if
              it is not used.
deprecation:
  - |
    When using deployed-server, the cidr must now be specified in full cidr
    notation. Network size alone (cidr:: 24) is deprecated..
    For example::
      DeployedServerPortMap:
        control_virtual_ip:
          fixed_ips:
            - ip_address: 192.168.100.1
          subnets:
            - cidr: 192.168.100.0/24
