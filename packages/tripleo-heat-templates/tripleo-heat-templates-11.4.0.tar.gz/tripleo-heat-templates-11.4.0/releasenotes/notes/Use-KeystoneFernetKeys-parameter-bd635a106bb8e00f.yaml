features:
  - The KeystoneFernetKeys parameter was introduced, which is able to take any
    amount of keys as long as it's in the right format. It's generated by the
    same mechanism as the rest of the passwords; so it's value is also
    available via mistral's "password" environment variable. This will also
    allow for rotations to be made via mistral and via stack updates.
deprecations:
  - The individual keystone fernet key parameters (KeystoneFernetKey0 and
    KeystoneFernetKey1) were deprecated in favor of KeystoneFernetKeys.
