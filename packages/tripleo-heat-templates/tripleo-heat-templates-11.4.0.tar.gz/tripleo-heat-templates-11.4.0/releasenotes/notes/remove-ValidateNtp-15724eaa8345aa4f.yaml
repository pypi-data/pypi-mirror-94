    The ValidateNtp has been removed from the all nodes validation configuration.
    During the time sync configuration we already do a check to ensure the ntp
    servers are available. If they are not we will fail with an appropriate message.
    The ValidateNtp option came from a time before we could fail in a more
    explicit way.
