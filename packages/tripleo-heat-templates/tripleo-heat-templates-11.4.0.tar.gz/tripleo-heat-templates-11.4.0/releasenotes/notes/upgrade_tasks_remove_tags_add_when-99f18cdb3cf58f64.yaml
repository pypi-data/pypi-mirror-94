upgrade:
  - |
    Since we are now running the ansible-playbooks with a step variable
    rather than via Heat SoftwareConfig/Deployments, the per service
    upgrade_tasks need to use "when: step|int == [0-6]" rather than
    "tags: step[0-6]" to signal the step at which the given task is to be
    invoked. This also applies to the update_tasks that are used for the
    minor update. This also deprecates the upgrade_batch_tasks
