fixes:
  - The default values for the PcsdPassword and PacemakerRemoteAuthkey
    parameters have been removed, as they did not result in a functioning
    pacemaker installation. These values are instead generated by
    tripleo-common, and in the cases where they are not (direct API), we want
    to fail explicitly if they are not provided.
