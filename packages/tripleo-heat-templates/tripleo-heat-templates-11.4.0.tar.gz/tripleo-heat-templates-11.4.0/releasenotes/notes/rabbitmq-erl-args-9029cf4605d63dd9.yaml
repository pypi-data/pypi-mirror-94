    A new parameter called 'RabbitAdditionalErlArgs' that specifies additional arguments
    to the Erlang VM has been added. It now defaults to "'+sbwt none'" (http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#+sbwt)
    This threshold determines how long schedulers are to busy wait when running out of work before going to sleep.
    By setting it to none we let the erlang threads go to sleep right away when they do not have any work to
    do.
