    Add boolean parameter `NovaSchedulerLimitTenantsToPlacementAggregate` which
    allows to set `scheduler/limit_tenants_to_placement_aggregate` parameter
    value, to have tenant isolation with placement. It ensures hosts are in
    tenant-isolated host aggregate and availability zones will only be available
    to specific set of tenants.
    Default value for NovaSchedulerLimitTenantsToPlacementAggregate is false.
