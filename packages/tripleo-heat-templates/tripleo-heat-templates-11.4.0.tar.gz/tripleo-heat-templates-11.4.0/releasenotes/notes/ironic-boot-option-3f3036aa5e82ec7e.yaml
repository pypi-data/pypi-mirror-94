    boot option to use for bare metal instances in the overcloud.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default boot option for bare metal instances in overcloud was changed
    to "local". This was already the default for whole-disk images, but for
    partition images it requires ``grub2`` to be installed on them.
    Use the new ``IronicDefaultBootOption`` configuration to override, or
    set ``boot_option`` capability on nodes and flavors.
