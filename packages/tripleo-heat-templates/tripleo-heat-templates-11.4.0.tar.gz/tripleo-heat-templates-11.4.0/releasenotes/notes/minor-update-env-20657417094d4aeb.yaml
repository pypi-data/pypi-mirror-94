    It is now possible for temporary containers inside THT to test if they are being run
    as part of a minor update by checking if the TRIPLEO_MINOR_UPDATE environment
    variable is set to 'true' (said containers need to export it to the container explicitely),
    see <service>_restart_bundles for examples.
