    The new StackUpdateType parameter is now set to UPGRADE
    when a major version upgrade is in progress.  This enables application
    configuration via puppet to distinuish a major version upgrade from a
    normal stack update (e.g for minor updates or reconfiguration) by
    inspecting the stack_update_type hiera value.  In future other values may be added to
    flag e.g minor updates vs reconfiguration, but for now only UPGRADE is considered.
