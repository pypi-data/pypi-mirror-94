    A new routes field is available for the network definition in
    ``network_data.yaml``. This field contains a list of network routes.
    For example::

      routes:
        - destination: 10.0.1.0/24
          nexthop: 10.0.0.1
        - destination: 10.0.2.0/24
          nexthop: 10.0.0.1

    The routes are used to set the  ``host_routes`` property of the neutron
    subnet resource created for the network.
