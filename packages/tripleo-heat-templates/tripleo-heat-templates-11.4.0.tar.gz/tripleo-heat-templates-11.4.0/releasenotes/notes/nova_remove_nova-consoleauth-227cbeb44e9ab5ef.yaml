    As of Rocky [1], the nova-consoleauth service has been deprecated and
    cell databases are used for storing token authorizations. All new consoles
    will be supported by the database backend and existing consoles will be
    reset. Console proxies must be run per cell because the new console token
    authorizations are stored in cell databases.

    nova-consoleauth was deprecated in tripleo with:
    I68485a6c4da4476d07ec0ab5e7b5a4c528820a4f

    This change now removes the NovaConsoleauth Service.
