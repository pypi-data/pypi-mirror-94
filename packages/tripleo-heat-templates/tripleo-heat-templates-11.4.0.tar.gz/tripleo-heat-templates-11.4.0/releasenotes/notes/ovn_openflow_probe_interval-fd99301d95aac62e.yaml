    Added new heat param OVNOpenflowProbeInterval to set ovn_openflow_probe_interval
    which is inactivity probe interval of the OpenFlow connection to the OpenvSwitch
    integration bridge, in seconds. If the value is zero, it disables the connection
    keepalive feature, by default this value is set on 60s.
    If the value is nonzero, then it will be forced to a value of at least 5s.
