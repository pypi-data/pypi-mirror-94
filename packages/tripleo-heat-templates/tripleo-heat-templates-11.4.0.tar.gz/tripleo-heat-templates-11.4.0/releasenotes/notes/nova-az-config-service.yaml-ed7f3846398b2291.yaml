features:
  - A new service, OS::TripleO::Services::NovaAZConfig, is available which can
    be used to create a host aggregate and availabiity zone in Nova during the
    deployment. Compute nodes in the deployment will also be added to the zone.
    The zone name is set with the parameter value NovaComputeAvailabilityZone.
    If let unset, it will default to the root stack name. By default the
    service is mapped to None, but can be enabled by including
    environments/nova-az-config.yaml.
