features:
  - |
    We now provide an example set of environment files that can be used to
    deploy a single all-in-one standalone cloud node via the
    'openstack overcloud deploy' and 'openstack tripleo deploy' (experimental)
    commands.
    For the overcloud deployment, use `environments/standalone/standalone-overcloud.yaml`.
    For the tripleo deploy deployment, use `environments/standalone/standalone-tripleo.yaml`.
deprecations:
  - |
    The environments/standalone.yaml has been deprecated and should be replaced
    with environments/standalone/standalone-tripleo.yaml when using the
    'openstack tripleo deploy' command.
