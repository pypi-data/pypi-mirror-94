    introduced THT parameters to set libvirt/cpu_mode. The patch sets the
    NovaLibvirtCPUMode wrong to 'none' string which results in puppet-nova
    not to handle the default cases correct and sets libvirt/cpu_mode to
    none which results in 'qemu64' CPU model, which is highly buggy and
    undesirable for production usage.  This changes the default to the
    recommended CPU mode 'host-model', for various benefits documented
    elsewhere.
