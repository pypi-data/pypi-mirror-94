    Network templates are now rendered with jinja2 based on network_data.yaml.
    The only required parameter for each network is the name, optional params
    will populate the defaults in the network template. Network templates
    will be generated for both IPv4 and IPv6 versions of the networks, setting
    ipv6: true on the network will generate only IPv6 templates. An example for
    overriding default IP addresses for IPv6 has been added in
    environments/network-environment-v6.yaml.
