    Support for predictable IP addressing added to the default port templates.
    In previous releases the use of _from_pool templates was required to have
    predictable ip addresses assigned to the nodes. Use of the
    ``port_from_pool`` templates is no longer required. The interface to
    configure predictable IP addressing without ``port_from_pool`` templates is
    the same. For example::

      parameter_defaults:
        ControllerIPs:
          intapi:
            - 10.0.0.10
            - 10.0.0.11
          external:
            - 172.16.1.10
            - 172.16.1.11

    Support for predictable IP addressing has been added to the default port
    templates. This however has not been tested for upgrades. If upgrading
    continues use of the _from_pool templates is required.
