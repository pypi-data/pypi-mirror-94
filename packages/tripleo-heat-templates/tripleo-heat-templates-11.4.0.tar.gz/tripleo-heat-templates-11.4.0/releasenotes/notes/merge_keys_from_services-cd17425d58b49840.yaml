    It is now possible to specify values for any key in `config_settings`
    from multiple services; multiple values will be merged using YAQL
    mergeWith() function. For example, assuming two services defining
    a key as follows:

      config_settings:
        mykey:
        - val1

      config_settings:
        mykey:
        - val2
        - val3

    the content of the key, as seen by ansible or puppet on the nodes,
    will be:

      mykey: ['val1','val2','val3']
