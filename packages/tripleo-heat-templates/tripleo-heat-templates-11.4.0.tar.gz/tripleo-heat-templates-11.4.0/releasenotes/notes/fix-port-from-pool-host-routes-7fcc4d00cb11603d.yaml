    Fixes an issue in the legacy port_from_pool templates for predictable IP
    addressing. Prior to this fix using these tamplates would fail with the
    following error: **Referenced Attribute (%network_name%%Port host_routes)
    is incorrect.** (Bug: `1792968
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1792968>`_.)
