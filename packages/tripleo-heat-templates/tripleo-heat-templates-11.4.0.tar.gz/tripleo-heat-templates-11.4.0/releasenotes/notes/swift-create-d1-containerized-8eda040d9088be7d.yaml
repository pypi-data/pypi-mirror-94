fixes:
    Swift added a requirement to ensure that storage directories exist before
    using them. However, when local directories are used in Tripleo (storing
    data in /srv/node/d1), these are missing by default and thus Swift won't
    store any data. This fix creates this directory if needed on a
    containerized environment.
