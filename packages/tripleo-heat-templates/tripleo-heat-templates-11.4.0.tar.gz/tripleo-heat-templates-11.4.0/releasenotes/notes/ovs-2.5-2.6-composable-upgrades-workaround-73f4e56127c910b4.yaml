issues:
  - During the ovs upgrade for 2.5 to 2.6 we need to workaround the classic
    yum update command by handling the upgrade of the package separately to not
    loose the IPs and the connectivity on the nodes. The workaround is
    discussed here https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1669714
upgrade:
  - The upgrade from openvswitch 2.5 to 2.6 is handled gracefully and there should
    be no user impact in particular no restart of the openvswitch service. For more
    information please see the related bug above which also links the relevant code reviews.
    The workaround (transparent to the user/doesn't require any input) is to download the OVS
    package and install with --nopostun and --notriggerun options provided by the rpm binary.
