features:
  - Adds the ability to set ``external_resource_network_id`` for the network,
    ``external_resource_vip_id`` for the network VIP,
    ``external_resource_subnet_id`` for the subnet(s), and
    ``external_resource_segment_id`` for the segment(s) to network_data.yaml.
    When setting these properties, the external_id attribute will be set on the
    corresponding Heat resources. This causes Heat to not re-create these
    resources and instead adopt them from outside the stack.
