    Add boolean parameter `NovaSchedulerEnableIsolatedAggregateFiltering`
    which allows to set `scheduler/enable_isolated_aggregate_filtering`
    parameter. This configures scheduler to restrict hosts in aggregates based
    on matching required traits in the aggregate metadata and the instance
    flavor/image. If an aggregate is configured with a property with key
    trait:$TRAIT_NAME and value required, the instance flavor extra_specs
    and/or image metadata must also contain trait:$TRAIT_NAME=required to
    be eligible to be scheduled to hosts in that aggregate.
    Default value for NovaSchedulerEnableIsolatedAggregateFiltering is False.
