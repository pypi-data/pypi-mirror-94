    It is now possible to trigger Mistral workflows or workflow actions
    before a deployment step is applied. This can be defined within the
    scope of a service template and is described as a task property
    for the Heat OS::Mistral::Workflow resource, for more details also
    see the puppet/services/README.rst file.
