features:
  - |
    Add support for cold migration over ssh.

    This enables nova cold migration.

    This also switches to SSH as the default transport for live-migration.
    The tripleo-common mistral action that generates passwords supplies the
    MigrationSshKey parameter that enables this.
deprecations:
  - |
    The TCP transport is no longer used for live-migration and the firewall
    port has been closed.
