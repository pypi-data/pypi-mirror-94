    Ironic in the containerized undercloud now supports the ``direct`` deploy
    interface for better performance and scalability. See
    `the direct deploy documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/interfaces/deploy.html#direct-deploy>`_
    for details.

    This deploy interface can be enabled per node by setting the node's
    ``deploy_interface`` field to ``direct`` or globally by changing the new
    ``IronicDefaultDeployInterface`` parameter to ``direct``.
