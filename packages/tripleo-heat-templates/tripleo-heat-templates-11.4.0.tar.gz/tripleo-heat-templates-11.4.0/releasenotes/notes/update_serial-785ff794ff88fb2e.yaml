    The new role variable update_serial is introduced
    allowing parallel update execution. On Controller
    role this variable defaults to 1 as pacemaker
    has to be taken down and up in rolling fashion.
    The default value is 25 as that is default value
    for parallel ansible execution used by tripleo.
