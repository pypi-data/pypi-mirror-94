    Ansible GroupVars incorrectly keept a single subnet prefix per-network.
    This caused a problem when multiple subnets using different subnet
    prefixes where defined. Resulting in the wrong subnet prefix being
    referenced in the NetworkConfig for roles.

    AnsibleHostVars stores networks subnet prefixes instead.
