    Introduces two new parameters to configure the archive deleted
    instances cron job.
    1) NovaCronArchiveDeleteAllCells
    To make sure deleted instances get archived also from the cell0
    in a single cell deployment and also in additional cell databases
    in case of a multi cell deployment.
    
    2) NovaCronArchiveDeleteRowsAge
    --before is required to prevent the orphaning of libvirt guests
    if/when nova-compute is down when a db archive cron job fires.
    
    This change also modifies
    1) the default from 100 to 1000 for NovaCronArchiveDeleteRowsMaxRows
    to match the default from the nova-manage command instead the default
    of 100 from the puppet-nova parameter.
    
    2) changes the default for NovaCronPurgeShadowTablesAllCells from
    false to true also the nova-manage db purge command needs to run
    for all cells instead of only the default cell.
