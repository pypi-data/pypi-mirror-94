    Use Keystone internal endpoint instead of admin for services.
    The admin endpoint is listening on the ctlplane network by default;
    services should ideally be using the internal api network for this kind
    of traffic, as the ctlplane network is mostly for provisioning. On the
    other hand, the admin endpoint shouldn't be as relevant with services
    switching to keystone v3.
