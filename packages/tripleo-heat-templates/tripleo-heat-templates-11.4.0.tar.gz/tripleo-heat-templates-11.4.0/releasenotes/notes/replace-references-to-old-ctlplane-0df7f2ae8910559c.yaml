upgrade:
  - |
    The default network for the ctlplane changed from 192.0.2.0/24 to
    192.168.24.0/24. All references to the ctlplane network in the templates
    have been updated to reflect this change. When upgrading from a previous
    release, if the default network was used for the ctlplane (192.0.2.0/24),
    then it is necessary to provide as input, via environment file, the correct
    setting for all the parameters that previously defaulted to 192.0.2.x and
    now default to 192.168.24.x; there is an environment file which could be
    used on upgrade `environments/updates/update-from-192_0_2-subnet.yaml` to
    cover a simple scenario but it won't be enough for scenarios using an
    external load balancer, Contrail or Cisto N1KV. Follows a list of params to
    be provided on upgrade.
    From contrail-net.yaml: EC2MetadataIp, ControlPlaneDefaultRoute
    From external-loadbalancer-vip-v6.yaml: ControlFixedIPs
    From external-loadbalancer-vip.yaml: ControlFixedIPs
    From network-environment.yaml: EC2MetadataIp, ControlPlaneDefaultRoute
    From neutron-ml2-cisco-n1kv.yaml: N1000vVSMIP, N1000vMgmtGatewayIP
    From contrail-vrouter.yaml: ContrailVrouterGateway
