  - Add the ability to deploy PTP. Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol
    used to synchronize clocks throughout a compute network. With hardware
    timestamping support on the host, PTP can achieve clock accuracy in the
    sub-microsecond range. PTP can be used as an alternative to NTP for high
    precision clock calibration.
