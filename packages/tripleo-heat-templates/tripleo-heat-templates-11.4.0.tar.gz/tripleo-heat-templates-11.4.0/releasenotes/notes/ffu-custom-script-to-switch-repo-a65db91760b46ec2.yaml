    The user can now use a custom script to switch repo during the
    fast forward upgrade.  He/She has to set ``FastForwardRepoType``
    to ``custom-script`` and set
    ``FastForwardCustomRepoScriptContent`` to a string representing a
    shell script.  That script will be executed on each node and given
    the upstream name of the release as the first argument (ocata,
    pike, queens in that order).  Here is an example that describes
    its interface.

    .. code-block:: bash

        #!/bin/bash
        case $1 in
          ocata)
            curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/ocata.repo http://somewhere.com/my-Ocata.repo;
            yum clean metadata;
          pike)
            curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/pike.repo http://somewhere.com/my-Pike.repo;
            yum clean metadata;
          queens)
            curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/pike.repo http://somewhere.com/my-Queens.repo;
            yum clean metadata;
          *)
            echo "unknown release $1" >&2
            exit 1
        esac
