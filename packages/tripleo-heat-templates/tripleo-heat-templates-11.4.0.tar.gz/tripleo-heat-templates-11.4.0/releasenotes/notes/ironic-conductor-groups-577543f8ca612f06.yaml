    `IronicConductorGroup` allows to define an Ironic Conductor Group so
    that the managed baremetal nodes may be later manually distributed by
    operators across multiple conductors. By default,
    `IronicConductorGroup` takes an empty value, which creates no
    conductor groups associated with the given Ironic Conductor service
    instance.

    .. note:: There is the default Ironic conductor group named "''", but
      it cannot be re-defined with `IronicConductorGroup` because of the
      empty value has been reserved for another purposes in t-h-t.
