    Historically if a puppet definition for a pacemaker resource did change
    puppet would not update it. We now enable the updating of pacemaker resources
    by default. The main use case being restarting a bundle when a bind mount gets
    added. Puppet will wait for the resource to completely restart before
    proceeding with the deploy.
