    It is no longer a requirement to provide the parameter: ``DnsServers``
    in the environment when deploying. Now ``get_attr`` on the server resource
    is used to resolve the value from the ``ctlplane`` subnet's
    ``dns_nameservers`` attribute. A conditional is used to determine if the
    user provided the parameter in the environment. If the user provided the
    parameter, the user provided value is used.

    Since the ``DnsServers`` can now be resolved from the ``ctlplane``
    subnet(s) this parameter can be removed from the environment
    (``network-environment.yaml``).

    .. Note:: Prior to removing the parameter ensure that the property of
              the ``ctlplane`` subnet(s) is correct. In case it is not, update
              ``undercloud.conf`` with the correct configuration and re-run the
              ``openstack undercloud install`` command to ensure the property
              is set correctly.

    .. Note:: ``DnsServers`` is now passed to the network config template when
              the resource is created. Because of this the parameter must be
              defined in the network config template, even if it is not used.
