    With OOO we configure a separate DB for placement for the undercloud and
    overcloud since the beginning.
    But the placement_database config options were reverted with
    https://review.opendev.org/#/c/442762/1 , which means so far even if
    the config option was set, it was not used. With rocky the options were
    introduced again which is not a problem on a fresh installed env, but on
    upgrades from queens to rocky.
    We should use the same DB for both fresh deployments on and upgrades to
    rocky before we switch to the new DB as part of the extraction of placement.
