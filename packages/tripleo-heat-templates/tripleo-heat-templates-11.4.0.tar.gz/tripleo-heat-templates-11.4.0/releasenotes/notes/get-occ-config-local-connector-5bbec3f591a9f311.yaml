fixes:
  - The deployed-server Heat agent configuration script,
    get-occ-config.sh, is now updated to configure the
    local data source for os-collect-config instead of
    configuring /etc/os-collect-config.conf directly. Doing
    so means that the configuration template for os-apply-config
    no longer has to be deleted as the file will be rendered
    correctly with the right data. See
