upgrade:
  - |
    The bare metal service (ironic) no longer allows nodes in maintenance
    to enter deployment or cleaning. If a node enters maintenance during
    deployment or cleaning, the process will be immediately aborted.
fixes:
  - |
    Deployment or cleaning of bare metal nodes no longer gets stuck if a node
    is in maintenance mode. The process is aborted instead and has to be
    restarted after moving the node out of maintenance.
