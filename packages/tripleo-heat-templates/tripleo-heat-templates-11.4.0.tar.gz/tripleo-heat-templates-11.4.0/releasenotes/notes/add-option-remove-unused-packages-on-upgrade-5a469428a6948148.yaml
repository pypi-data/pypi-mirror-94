upgrade:
  - Adds a new UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages parameter (default False) and some
    service upgrade_tasks that use this parameter to remove any unused
    packages. "Unused" is those services that are being stopped and disabled
    from starting on boot (because they are being containerized). Note that
    ignore_errors is set on all the package removal ansible tasks so any
    issues removing a given package will not fail the upgrade workflow.

    For clarity, setting UpgradeRemoveUnusedPackages to True in your deployment
    environment file(s) will result in the REMOVAL of packages for stopped
    and disabled services, during the upgrade.
