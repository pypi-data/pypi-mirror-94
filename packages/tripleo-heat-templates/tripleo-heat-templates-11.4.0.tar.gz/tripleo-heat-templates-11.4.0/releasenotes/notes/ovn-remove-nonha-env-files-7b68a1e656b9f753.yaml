    Removed environment files to deploy OVN db servers in non HA mode for OVN
    deployments as it is not recommended. There is no support to upgrade an existing
    OVN deployments from non HA to HA. It is recommended to have a fresh deployment.
    To deploy OVN with dvr support, use environment/services/neutron-ovn-dvr-ha.yaml,
    otherwise use environment/services/neutron-ovn-ha.yaml
