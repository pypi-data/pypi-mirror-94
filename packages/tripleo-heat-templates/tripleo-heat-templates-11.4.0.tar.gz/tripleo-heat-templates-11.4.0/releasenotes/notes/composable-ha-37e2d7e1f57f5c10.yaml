features:
  - With the composable HA work landed it is now possible
    to split pacemaker-managed services like galera, rabbit,
    redis, haproxy and any A/P resource, off to dedicated
    nodes. These services can be split off to separate nodes
    either via the normal Pacemaker service (which has a limit
    of 16 maximum number of nodes) or via the newer PacemakerRemote
    service (but not both on the same node). Note that until
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1417936 is fixed,
    PacemakerRemote should only be used for Cinder A/P resources
    and Manila A/P resources.
