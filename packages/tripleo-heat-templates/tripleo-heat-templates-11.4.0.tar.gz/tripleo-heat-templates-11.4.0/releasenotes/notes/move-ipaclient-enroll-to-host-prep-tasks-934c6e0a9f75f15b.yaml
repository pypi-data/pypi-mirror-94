    When setting up TLS everywhere, some deployers may not have their FreIPA
    server in the ctlplane, causing the ipaclient registration to fail.
    We move this registration to host-prep tasks and invoke it using ansible.
    At this point, all networks should be set up and the FreeIPA server should
    be accessible.
