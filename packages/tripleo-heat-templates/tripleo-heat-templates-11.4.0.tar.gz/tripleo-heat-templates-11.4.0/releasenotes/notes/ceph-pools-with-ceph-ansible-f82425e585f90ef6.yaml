    The format to use for the CephPools parameter needs to be updated into the
    form expected by ceph-ansible. For example, for a new pool named `mypool`
    it should change from:
    { "mypool": { "size": 3, "pg_num": 128, "pgp_num": 128 } }
    into:
    [ { "name": "mypool", "pg_num": 128, "rule_name": "" } ]
    The first is a map where each key is a pool name and its value the pool
    properties, the second is a list where each item describes all properties
    of a pool, including its name.

    With the migration from puppet-ceph to ceph-ansible for the deployment
    of Ceph, the format of CephPools parameter changes because the two tools
    use a different format to represent the list of additional pools to create.
