upgrade:
  - |
    The fs.suid_dumpable kernel parameter is now explicitly set to 0 to prevent
    exposing sensitive data through core dumps of processes with elevated
    permissions. Deployments that set or depend on non-zero values for
    fs.suid_dumpable may be affected by upgrading.
security:
  - |
    Explicitly disable core dump for setuid programs by setting
    fs.suid_dumpable = 0, this will descrease the risk of unauthorized access
    of core dump file generated by setuid program.
