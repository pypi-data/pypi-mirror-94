features:
  - Add 2 new example environments to facilitate deploying split-stack,
    environments/overcloud-baremetal.j2.yaml and
    environments/overcloud-services.yaml. The environments are used to deploy two
    separate Heat stacks, one for just the baremetal+network configuration and one
    for the service configuration.
