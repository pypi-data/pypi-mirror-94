    The parameter ``ControlPlaneSubnetCidr`` was missing in the
    ``network/ports/net_vip_map_external.j2.yaml`` and
    ``network/ports/net_vip_map_external_v6.j2.yaml`` template files. This
    caused deployment failure since the ``VipMap`` resource pass this
    property. (See Bug: 
    `#1864912 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1864912>`_)
