upgrade:
  - Mongodb is no longer used by default, so now one has to enable it
    explicitly if there's a need for using it.
other:
  - Mongodb is not used by any service we enable by default, so it has been
    removed from the default services. It has subsequently been added to the
    services that use it (zaqar and ceilometer-collector).
