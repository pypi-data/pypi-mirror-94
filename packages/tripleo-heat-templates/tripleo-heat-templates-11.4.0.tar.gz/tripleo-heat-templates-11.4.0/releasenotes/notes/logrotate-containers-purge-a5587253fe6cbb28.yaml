    The 'LogrotatePurgeAfterDays'
    enforces cleaning up of information exceeded its life-time
    (defaults to a 14 days) in the /var/log/containers directory of
    bare metal overcloud hosts, including upgrade (from containers)
    cases, when leftovers may be remaining on the host systems.

    New heat parameters for containerized services 'LogrotateMaxsize',
    'LogrotateRotationInterval', 'LogrotateRotate' and
    'LogrotatePurgeAfterDays' allow customizing size/time-based rules
    for the containerized services logs rotation.
    The time based rules prevail over all.
