    Add the ``ContainerImagePrepareLogFile`` heat parameter, which points to
    a log file to store outputs of the
    ``openstack tripleo container image prepare`` commands
    invoked by ansible for containers registry deployments.
    As it takes quite a while to finish, and may be retrying intermittent
    failures, make the command to log ``--verbose`` details as well.

    The default log file ``tripleo-container-image-prepare.log`` will
    be placed in the directory containing downloaded ansible playbooks and
    inventory files. For undercloud deployments, logs destination is shared
    with the default ``install-undercloud.log`` file.
