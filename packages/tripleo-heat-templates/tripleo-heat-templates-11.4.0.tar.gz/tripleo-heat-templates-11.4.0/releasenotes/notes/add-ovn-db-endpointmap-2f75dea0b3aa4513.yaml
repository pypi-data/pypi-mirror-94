    Add OvnDbInternal to EndpointMap and use it for ovn_db_host

    OVN controller/metadata use ovn_dbs_vip hiera key to configure
    the central ovn DB. This key is not available on split control
    plane or multi cell setup and therefore installation fails.

    With this change a new entry gets created in the EndpointMap
    named OvnDbInternal. This can then be exported for an overcloud
    stack and can be used as an input for the cell stack.

    The information from the EndpointMap is used for ovn-metadata
    and ovn-controller as the ovn_db_host information in puppet-tripleo
