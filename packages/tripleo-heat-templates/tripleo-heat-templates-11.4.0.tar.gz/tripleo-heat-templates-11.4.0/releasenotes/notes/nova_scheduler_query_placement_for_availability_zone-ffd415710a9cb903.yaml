    Add boolean parameter `NovaSchedulerQueryPlacementForAvailabilityZone`
    that sets `scheduler/query_placement_for_availability_zone` parameter.
    It allows the scheduler to look up a host aggregate with metadata key
    of availability zone set to the value provided by incoming request, and
    request result from placement be limited to that aggregate.
    Default value for NovaSchedulerQueryPlacementForAvailabilityZone is false.
