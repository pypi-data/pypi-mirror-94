    Add the ability to configure the cinder-volume service to run in
    active-active (A/A) mode using the cluster name specified by the new
    CinderVolumeCluster parameter. Note that A/A mode requires the backend
    driver support running A/A. Cinder's RBD driver supports A/A, but most
    other cinder drivers currently do not.
