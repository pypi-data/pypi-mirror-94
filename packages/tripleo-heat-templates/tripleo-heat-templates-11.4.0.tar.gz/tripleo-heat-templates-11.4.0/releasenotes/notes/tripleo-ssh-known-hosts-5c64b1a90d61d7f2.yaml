fixes:
  - Add support for the SshKnownHostsDeployment resources to config-download.
    Since the deployment resources relied on Heat outputs, they were not
    supported with the default handling from tripleo-common that relies on the
    group_vars mechanism.  The templates have been refactored to add
    the known hosts entries as global_vars to deploy_steps_playbook.yaml, and
    then include the new tripleo-ssh-known-hosts role from tripleo-common to
    apply the same configuration that the Heat deployment did.
