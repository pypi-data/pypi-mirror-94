    The MTU defined for the ``Tenant`` network in network_data is now used to
    set neutron's ``global_physnet_mtu`` unless the ``NeutronGlobalPhysnetMtu``
    parameter is used to override the default. (Neutron uses the
    ``global_physnet_mtu`` value to calculate MTU for all virtual network
    components. For flat and VLAN networks, neutron uses this value without
    modification. For overlay networks such as VXLAN, neutron automatically
    subtracts the overlay protocol overhead from this value.)
