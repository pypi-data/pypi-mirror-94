    Swift rings created or updated on the overcloud nodes will now be
    stored on the undercloud at the end of each deployment. They will be
    retrieved before any deployment update, and by doing this the Swift
    rings will be in a consistent state across the cluster all the time.
    This makes it possible to add, remove or replace nodes without
    manual operator interaction.
