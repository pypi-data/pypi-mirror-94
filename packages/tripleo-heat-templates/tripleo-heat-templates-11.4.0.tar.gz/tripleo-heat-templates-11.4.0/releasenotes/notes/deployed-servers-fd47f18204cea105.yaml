features:
  - It is now possible to deploy with tripleo-heat-templates using servers that
    are already provisioned with an operating system, and not necessarily
    provisioned with Nova and Ironic. This feature is enabled by making use of
    the environments/deployed-server-environment.yaml environment file. For
    more information, see
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-docs/advanced_deployment/deployed_server.html
