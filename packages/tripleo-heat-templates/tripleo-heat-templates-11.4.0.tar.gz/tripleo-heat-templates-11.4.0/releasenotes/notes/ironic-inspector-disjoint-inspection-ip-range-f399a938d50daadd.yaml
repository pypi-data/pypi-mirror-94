    Adds support to configure disjoint address pools for Ironic Inspector.

    When Inspector is deployed as a HA service disjoint address pools should be
    served by the DHCP instances to avoid address conflict issues. The disjoint
    address pools are configured by using hostname (short form) as the key,
    then pass the list of ranges for each host. For example::

      parameter_defaults:

        IronicInspectorSubnets:
          overcloud-ironic-0:
            - ip_range: 192.168.24.100,192.168.24.119
            - ip_range: 192.168.25.100,192.168.25.119
              netmask: 255.255.255.0
              gateway: 192.168.25.254
              tag: subnet1
          overcloud-ironic-1:
            - ip_range: 192.168.24.120,192.168.24.139
            - ip_range: 192.168.25.120,192.168.25.139
              netmask: 255.255.255.0
              gateway: 192.168.25.254
              tag: subnet1
