    Parameter `scheduler/query_placement_for_image_type_support` is enabled
    by default for all deployments. Setting it causes the scheduler to ask
    Placement only for compute hosts that support the `disk_format` of the
    image used in the request which is beneficial for example, the libvirt
    driver, when using Ceph as an ephemeral backend, does not support `qcow2`
    images (without an expensive conversion step).
