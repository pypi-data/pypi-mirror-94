    The *get_attr* function is now used to read the ``gateway_ip`` of a ports
    subnet. The gateway_ip value is passed to nic config templates using the
    ``%network%InterfaceDefaultRoute`` parameter. (This parameter is only used
    if the network is present in the roles ``default_route_networks``.) Using
    *get_attr* ensures that the correct gateway ip address is used when
    networks have multiple subnets.
