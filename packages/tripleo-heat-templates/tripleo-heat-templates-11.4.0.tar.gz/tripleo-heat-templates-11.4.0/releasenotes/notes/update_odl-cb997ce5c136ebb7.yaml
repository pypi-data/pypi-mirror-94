  - Minor update ODL steps are added. ODL minor update (within same ODL
    release) can have 2 different workflow. These are called level 1 and
    level2. Level 1 is simple - stop, update and start ODL. Level 2 is
    complex and involved yang model changes. This requires wiping of
    DB and resync to repopulate the data.
    Steps involved in level 2 update are
     1. Block OVS instances to connect to ODL
     2. Set ODL upgrade flag to True
     3. Start ODL
     4. Start Neutron re-sync and wait for it to finish
     5. Delete OVS groups and ports
     6. Stop OVS
     7. Unblock OVS ports
     8. Start OVS
     9. Unset ODL upgrade flag
    To achieve L2 update, use "-e environments/services-docker/
    update-odl.yaml" along with other env files to the update command.
