    Encryption of the internal network's communications through IPSec has been
    added. To enable you need to add the OS::TripleO::Services::Ipsec service
    to your roles if it's not there already. And you need to add the file
    environments/ipsec.yaml to your overcloud deploy.

    The ``IpsecVars`` parameter was added in order to configure the parameters
    in the tripleo-ipsec ansible role that configures IPSec tunnels if they're
    enabled.
