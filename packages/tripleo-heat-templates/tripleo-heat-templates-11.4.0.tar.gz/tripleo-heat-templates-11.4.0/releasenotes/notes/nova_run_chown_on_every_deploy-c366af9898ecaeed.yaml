    If nova-manage command was triggered on a host for the first time as root
    (usually manual runs) the nova-manage.log gets created as root user. On
    overcloud deploy runs the nova-manage command is run as nova user. In such
    situation the overcloud deploy fails as the nova user can not write to the
    nova-manage.log. With this change we run the chown of the logs files on
    every overcloud deploy to fix the nova-manage.log file permissions.
