    It is possible to deploy Ceph in docker containers in the overcloud. This
    is implemented by triggering `ceph-ansible` via a Mistral workflow. A new
    `CephAnsibleExtraConfig` parameter has been added to the templates and can
    be used to provide arbitrary config variables consumed by `ceph-ansible`.
    The pre-existing template params consumed by the TripleO Pike release to
    drive `puppet-ceph` continue to work and are translated, when possible, into
    their equivalent `ceph-ansible` variable. To enable the deployment of Ceph
    in containers use `environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible.yaml` when
    deploying the overcloud.
