    Support for Manila/CephFS with TripleO managed Ceph cluster
features:
  - |
    It is now possible to configure Manila with CephFS to use a
    TripleO managed Ceph cluster. When using the Heat environment
    file at environments/manila-cephfsnative-config.yaml Manila
    will be configured to use the TripleO managed Ceph cluster
    if CephMDS is deployed as well, which can be done using the
    file environments/services/ceph-mds.yaml
