features:
  - |
    Allow to configure the Message Queue notification driver.
    By default, we'll configure 'messagingv2' but we can now
    override NotificationDriver parameter and set 'noop' when
    we don't want notifications, which is the case when
    we disable Telemetry services.
deprecations:
  - KeystoneNotificationDriver is deprecated in favor of NotificationDriver.
