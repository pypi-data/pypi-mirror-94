    With 405366fa32583e88c34417e5f46fa574ed8f4e98 the parameters RpcPort,
    RpcUserName, RpcPassword and RpcUseSSL got deprecated and
    nova::rabbitmq_port removed. As a result the healtcheck get called with
    null parameter and fail.
    We now get the global_config_settings from RabbitMQService and use
    oslo_messaging_rpc_port for the healthcheck.
