    Each service template may optionally define a `fast_forward_upgrade_tasks`
    key, which is a list of ansible tasks to be performed during the
    fast-forward upgrade process. As with Upgrade steps each task is associated
    to a particular step provided as a variable and used along with a release
    variable by a basic conditional that determines when the task should run.
