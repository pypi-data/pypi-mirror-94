    Containerized services logs can be found under updated paths.
    Pacemaker-managed resources write logs to `/var/log/pacemaker/bundles/*`.
    Docker-daemon managed openstack services bind-mount their log files to the
    `/var/log/containers/<foo>/*` sub-directories. Services running under
    Apache2 WSGI use the `/var/log/containers/httpd/<foo-api>/*` destinations.
    Additional tools or commands that log to syslog, end up placing log records
    into the hosts journalctl and `/var/log/messages`.
