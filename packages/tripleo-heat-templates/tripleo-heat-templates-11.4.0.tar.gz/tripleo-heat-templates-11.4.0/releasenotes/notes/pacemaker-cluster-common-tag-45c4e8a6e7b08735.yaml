features:
  - HA services use a special container image name derived from the one
    configured in Heat parameter plus a fixed tag part, i.e.
    '<registry>/<namespace>/<servicename>:pcmklatest'. To implement rolling
    update without service disruption, this 'pcmklatest' tag is adjusted
    automatically during minor update every time a new image is pulled.
    A new Heat parameter ClusterCommonTag can now control the prefix part
    of the container image name. When set to true, the container name
    for HA services will look like
    'container-common-tag/<servicename>:pcmklatest'. This allows rolling
    update of HA services even when the <namespace> changes in Heat.
