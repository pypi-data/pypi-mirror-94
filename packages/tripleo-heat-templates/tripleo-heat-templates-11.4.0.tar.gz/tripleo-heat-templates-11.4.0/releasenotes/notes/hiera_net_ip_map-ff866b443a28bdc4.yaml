    Per-service config_settings should now use hiera interpolation to set
    the bind IP for services, e.g "%{hiera('internal_api')}" whereas prior
    to this release we replaced e.g internal_api for the IP address internally.
    The network name can still be derived from the ServiceNetMap - all the
    in-tree templates have been converted to the new format, but any out
    of tree templates may require similar adjustment.
