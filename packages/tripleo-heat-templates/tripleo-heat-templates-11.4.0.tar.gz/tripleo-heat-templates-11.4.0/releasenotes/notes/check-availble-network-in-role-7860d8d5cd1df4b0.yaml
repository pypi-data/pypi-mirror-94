upgrade:
  - |
    Deployers that used ``resource_registry`` override in their environment
    to add networks to roles without also using a custom roles data file must
    create a custom roles data file and add the additional network(s) and use
    this when upgrading.

    Previously it was possible to add additional networks to a role without
    using a custom role by overriding the resource registry, for example::

      OS::TripleO::Compute::Ports::ExternalPort: ../network/ports/external.yaml

    .. Warning:: Since resources are no longer added to the plan unless the
                 network is specified in the role, the ``resource_registry``
                 override alone is no longer sufficient.
critical:
  - |
    Networks not specified for roles in roles data (``roles_data.yaml``) no
    longer have Heat resources created. It is now mandatory that custom roles
    are used when non-default networks is used for a role.

    Previously it was possible to add additional networks to a role without
    using a custom role by overriding the resource registry, for example::

      OS::TripleO::Compute::Ports::ExternalPort: ../network/ports/external.yaml

    .. Note:: The ``resource_registry`` override was the only requirement prior
              to the introduction of *Composable Networks* in the Pike release.

              Since Pike a custom role would ideally be used when adding
              networks to roles, but documentation and other guides may not
              have been properly updated and only mention the
              ``resource_registry`` override.
