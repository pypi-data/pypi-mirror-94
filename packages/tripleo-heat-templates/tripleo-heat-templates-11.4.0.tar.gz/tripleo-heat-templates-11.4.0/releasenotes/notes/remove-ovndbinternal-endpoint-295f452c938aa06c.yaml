    We revert I0d9eb663405d1113ea84e3c12651a3f0dbdfc75d and we instead
    export ovn_dbs_vip on all nodes so it can be used in cells. Reason for this
    is that we want a separate VIP for OVN because a) composable roles and b)
    we do not want to impose the extra promote master constraints on the internal_api
    VIP which ends up being used by OVN.
