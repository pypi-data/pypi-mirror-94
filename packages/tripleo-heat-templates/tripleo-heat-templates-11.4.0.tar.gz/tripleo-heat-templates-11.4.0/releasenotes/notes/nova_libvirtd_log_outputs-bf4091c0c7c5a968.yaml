    Adds LibvirtLogOutputs parameter to define how log outputs are sent,
    as described in https://libvirt.org/logging.html . In default, this
    parameter is set so that log outputs are directly recorded into
    /var/log/containers/libvirt/libvirtd.log .
    Default:
    '3:file:/var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log'
