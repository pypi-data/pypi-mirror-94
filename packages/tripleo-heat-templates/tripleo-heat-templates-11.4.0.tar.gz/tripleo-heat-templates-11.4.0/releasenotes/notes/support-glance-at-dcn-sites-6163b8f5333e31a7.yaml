    Add the ability to deploy the glance-api service at DCN/Edge sites. Glance
    service at the Edge shares the same database as the Glance service in the
    central control plane, but allows other services such as Cinder and Nova to
    access a Glance endpoint that is local to the DCN/Edge site.
