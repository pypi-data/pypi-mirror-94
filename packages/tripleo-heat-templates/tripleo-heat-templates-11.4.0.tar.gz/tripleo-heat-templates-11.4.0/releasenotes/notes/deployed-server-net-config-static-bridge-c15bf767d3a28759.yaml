fixes:
  - All roles now default to using the net-config-static-bridge.yaml nic config
    when using deployed-server. Since OVN is the default in TripleO, Compute
    roles need to have br-ex. Previously when using deployed-server, the default
    nic config for the non-Controller roles was net-config-static.yaml, which
    did not create br-ex.
