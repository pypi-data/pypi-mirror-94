    To isolate LVM volumes created by compute guests, within Cinder volumes, from
    the LVM volumes created/managed by the host itself, a new task has been
    introduced to create an allowlist and denylist of devices which should be
    accessible (or not) to the host, configured in lvm.conf using the
    global_filter key.
    The allowlist is generated gathering the list of existing in-use physical
    disks (or partitions) and appending to it any user provided device passed
    via `LVMFilterAllowlist` parameter.
    The denylist is configured via `LVMFilterDenylist` and defaults to ['.*'],
    which means it blocks any device not explicitly allowed.
    Both the list parameters can be specified per-role.
    The feature is, by default, disabled and can be enabled passing
    `LVMFilterEnabled: true`; when disabled the existing lvm.conf won't be
    touched and a version of it which includes the global_filter will be left,
    for debugging, in `/tmp/tripleo_lvmfilter.conf`.

    As per launchpad bug 1855704, the lvmfilter task aims at hiding to the
    host the LVM2 volumes created by compute guests in Cinder volumes or
    Glance images.
