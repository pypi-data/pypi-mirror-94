fixes:
  - Use StrictHostKeyChecking=no to inject the temporary ssh key in
    enable-ssh-admin.sh. The user provides the list of hosts for ssh, so we can
    safely assume that they intend to ssh to those hosts.  Also, for the ovb
    case the hosts will have new host ssh keys which have not yet been
    accepted.
