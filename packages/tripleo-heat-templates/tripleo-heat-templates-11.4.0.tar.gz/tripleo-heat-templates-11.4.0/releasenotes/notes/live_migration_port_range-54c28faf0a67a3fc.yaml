    By default, libvirtd uses ports from 49152 to 49215 for live-migration
    as specified in qemu.conf, that becomes a subset of ephemeral ports
    (from 32768 to 61000) used by many linux kernels.
    The issue here is that these ephemeral ports are used for outgoing TCP
    sockets. And live-migration might fail, if there are no port available
    from the specified range.
    Moving the port range out of ephemeral port range to be used only for
    live-migration.
