  script called by Heat.

  its variables (SSLCertificate, SSLIntermediateCertificate, SSLKey)
upgrade:
  - All NodeTLSData related resources must be removed.
  - SSLCertificate, SSLIntermediateCertificate, SSLKey are still used for the
    TLS configuration.
deprecations:
  - NodeTLSData is now deprecated.
