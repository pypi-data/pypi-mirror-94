features:
  - The ManageNetworks parameter has been added. The parameter controls
    management of the network and related resources (subnets and segments) with
    either create, update, or delete operations (depending on the stack
    operation).  Does not apply to ports which will always be managed as
    needed. Defaults to true. For multi-stack use cases where the network
    related resources have already been managed by a separate stack, this
    parameter can be set to false.
