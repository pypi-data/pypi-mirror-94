features:
  - |
    Add new BarbicanClient tripleo service for configuring DCN/Edge nodes
    to access a barbican service running in the control plane. The client
    service is disabled by default, and can be enabled by including the
    environments/services/barbican-edge.yaml environment file when deploying
    a DCN/Edge stack.
fixes:
  - |
    Ensure the barbican Key Manager settings are configured on DCN/Edge nodes
    when the barbican service is deployed in the control plane. See `bug 1886070
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1886070>`_.
