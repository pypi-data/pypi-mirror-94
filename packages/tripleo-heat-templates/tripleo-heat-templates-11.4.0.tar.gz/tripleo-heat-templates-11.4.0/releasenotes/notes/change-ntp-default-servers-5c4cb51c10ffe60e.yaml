    The NtpServer default set now includes multiple pool.ntp.org hosts to ensure
    that the time can be properly synced during the deployment. Having only a
    single timesource can lead to deployment failures if the time source is
    unavailable during the deployment. It is recommended that you either
    set multiple NtpServers or use the NtpPool configuration to ensure that
    enough time sources are available for the hosts. Note that the NtpPool
    configuration is only available when using chrony. See LP#1806521
