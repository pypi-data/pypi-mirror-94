    Empty /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/opendaylight/opt/
    opendaylight/etc/opendaylight/karaf directory on host empties
    /opt/opendaylight/etc/opendaylight/karaf inside the ODL container
    because of the mount. This leads to deployment failure on
    redeploy. Delete the empty karaf directory on host before
    redeploying.
