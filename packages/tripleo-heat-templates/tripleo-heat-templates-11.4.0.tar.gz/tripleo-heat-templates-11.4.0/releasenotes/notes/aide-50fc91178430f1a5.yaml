    Introduces a puppet service to configure AIDE Intrusion
    Detection. This service init's the database and copies the
    new database to the active naming. It also sets a cron job,
    when parameter `AideEmail` is populated, otherwise reports
    are sent to /var/log/aide/.

    AIDE rules can be supplied as a hash, and should the rules ever
    be changed, the service will populate the new rules and re-init
    a fresh integrity database.
