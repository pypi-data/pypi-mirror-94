features:
  - |
    Add new CinderNfsSnapshotSupport parameter, which controls whether
    cinder's NFS driver supports snapshots. The default value is True.
upgrade:
  - |
    Cinder's NFS driver does not support snapshots unless the feature is
    explicitly enabled (this policy was chosen to ensure compatibility with
    very old versions of libvirt). The CinderNfsSnapshotSupport default value
    is True, and so the new default behavior enables NFS snapshots. This
    change is safe because it just enables a capability (i.e. snapshots)
    that other cinder drivers generally provide.
