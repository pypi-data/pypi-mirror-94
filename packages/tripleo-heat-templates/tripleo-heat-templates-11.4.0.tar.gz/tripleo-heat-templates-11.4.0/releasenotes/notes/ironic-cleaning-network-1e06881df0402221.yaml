features:
  - |
    New parameter "IronicCleaningNetwork" can be used to override the name
    or UUID of the **overcloud** network Ironic uses for cleaning.
fixes:

    A default value is now provided for Ironic ``cleaning_network``
    configuration option. Not providing it on start up was deprecated since
    Newton, and will result in a failure in the near future.
