    Added code in the barbican-api.yaml template to allow barbican to be
    configured to run with either an  ATOS or Thales HSM back-end.  Also
    added environment files with all the required variables.  The added code
    installs and configures the client software on the barbican nodes,
    generates the required kets for the PKCS#11 plugin, and configures
    barbican correctly.  For the Thales case, it also contacts the RFS server
    to add the new clients to the HSM.
