    Add customized libvirt-guests unit file to properly shutdown instances

    If resume_guests_state_on_host_boot is set in nova.conf instances
    need to be shutdown using libvirt-guests after nova_compute container
    is shut down. Therefore we need a customized libvirt-guests unit file
    1) removes the dependency to libvirt (non container) that it don't
    get started as a dependency and make the nova_libvirt container to fail.
    2) adds a dependency to docker related services that a shutdown of
    nova_compute container is possible on system reboot.
    3) stops nova_compute container
    4) shutdown VMs

    This is a missing part of Bug 1778216.
