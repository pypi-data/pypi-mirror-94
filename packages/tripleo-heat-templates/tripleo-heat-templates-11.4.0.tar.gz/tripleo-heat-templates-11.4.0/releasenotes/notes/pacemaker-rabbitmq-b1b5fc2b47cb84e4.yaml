fixes:
  -- The pacemaker docker version for the rabbitmq service should also
     include the noop's for the for Rabbitmq_policy and Rabbitmq_user puppet
     resources that are noop'd in docker/services/rabbitmq.yaml These resources
     must be noop'd in puppet, otherwise they could be triggered during puppet
     apply's during the docker-puppet.py generate config step where rabbitmqctl
     is not actually running.
