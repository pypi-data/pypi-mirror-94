    We are not changing the rabbitmq ha-mode policy during upgrades any longer.
    The policy chosen at deploy time will remain the same but can be changed
    manually.
fixes:
  - |
    Due to https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1686337 we switch the
    default of rabbitmq back ha-mode "all". This is to make the installation
    more robust in the face of network issues.
