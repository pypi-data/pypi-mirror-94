upgrade:
  - |
    The environment file puppet-pacemaker.yaml has been removed, make
    sure that you no longer reference it. The docker-ha.yaml file
    should have already been used in place of puppet-pacemaker.yaml
    during upgrade from Ocata to Pike. The environment file
    puppet-pacemaker-no-restart.yaml has been removed too, it was only
    used in conjunction with puppet-pacemaker.yaml.
  - |
    The environment file deployed-server-pacemaker-environment.yaml
    has been removed, make sure that you no longer reference it. Its
    current contents result in no tangible difference from the default
    resource registry state, so removing the file should not change
    the overcloud.
