features:
  - |
    There is now a tool in tripleo-heat-templates, similar to the
    oslo-config-generator, that can be used to programmatically generate
    sample environment files based directly on the contents of the templates
    themselves.  This ensures consistency in the sample environments, as well
    as making it easier to update environments to reflect changes to the
    templates.
upgrade:
  - |
    Some sample environment files will be moving as part of the work to
    generate them programmatically.  The old versions will be left in place for
    one cycle to allow a smooth upgrade process.  When upgrading, if any of the
    environment files in use for the deployment have been deprecated they
    should be replaced with the new generated verions.
deprecations:
  - |
    Where a generated sample environment replaces an existing one, the existing
    environment is deprecated.  This will be noted in a comment at the top of
    the file.
