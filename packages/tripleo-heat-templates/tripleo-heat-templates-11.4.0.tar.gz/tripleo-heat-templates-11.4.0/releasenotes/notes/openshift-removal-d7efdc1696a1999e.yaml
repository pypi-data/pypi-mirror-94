    OpenShift deployed by TripleO support has been removed in a downstream
    version of Stein which make the upstream support difficult to maintain.
    OpenShift can be deployed using OpenShift-Ansible and
    users who desire to deploy OpenShift 3.11 onto bare metal nodes can
    still do so using openshift-ansible directly. The provisioning of
    the Operating System on baremetal can be done with OpenStack Ironic on
    the Overcloud or also can be done with deployed-servers, achieving the
    same result.
