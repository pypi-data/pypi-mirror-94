    Added new composable service (QDR) for containerized deployments. Metrics
    QDR will run on each overcloud node in 'edge' mode. This basically means
    that there is a possibility there will be two QDRs running on controllers
    in case that oslo messaging is deployed. This is a reason why we need
    separate composable service for this use case.
