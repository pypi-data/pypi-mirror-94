features:
  - The mappings from environments/config-download-environment.yaml are now
    included by default in overcloud-resource-registry.j2.yaml. config-download
    is now the default way of deploying. An environment at
    environments/disable-config-download.yaml is added to enable the previous
    method, but that method is deprecated.
deprecations:
  - environments/disable-config-download.yaml can be used to disable
    config-download but is deprecated.
