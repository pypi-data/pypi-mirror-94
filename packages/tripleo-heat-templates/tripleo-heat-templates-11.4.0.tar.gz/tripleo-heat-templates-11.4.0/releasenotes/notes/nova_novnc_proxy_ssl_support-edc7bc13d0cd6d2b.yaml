    When tls-everywhere is configured we have TLS connection from 
    client -> haproxy and novncproxy -> vnc server (instance), but the 
    connection from haproxy to the nova novnc proxy was not encrypted. Now 
    we request a certificate and configue haproxy  and the novnc proxy to
    encrypt this remaining part in a vnc connection to be encrypted as well.
