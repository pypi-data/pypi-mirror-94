deprecations:
  - |
    As of Rocky [1], the nova-consoleauth service has been deprecated and
    cell databases are used for storing token authorizations. All new consoles
    will be supported by the database backend and existing consoles will be
    reset. Console proxies must be run per cell because the new console token
    authorizations are stored in cell databases.

    Lets deprecate it also in tripleo so that it can be removed in a later
    release.
