    When using RHSM Service (deployment/rhsm/rhsm-baremetal-ansible.yaml) based
    registration of the overcloud nodes and enabling the KSM using
    NovaComputeEnableKsm=True the overcloud deployment will fail because the
    RHSM registration and the ksm task run as host_prep task. The handling
    of enable/disable ksm is now handled in deploy step 1.
