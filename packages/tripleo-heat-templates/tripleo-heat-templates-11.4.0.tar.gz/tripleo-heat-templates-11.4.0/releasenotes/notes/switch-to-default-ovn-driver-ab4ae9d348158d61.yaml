    This patch switches the default mechanism driver for neutron from
    openvswitch to OVN. DVR is now enabled by default which in the case
    of OVN means that we're distributing FIP N/S traffic
    as E/W is anyways distributed
upgrade:

    During upgrade from ml2/ovs please remember to provide similar
    environment file to environments/updates/update-from-ml2-ovs-from-rocky.yaml.
    This is good also to remember to provide this file as a first
    to avoid overwriting custom modification by upgrade environment
    file. If you will not provide such file during upgrade from
    ml2/ovs you will see error and notification about problems witch
    mutually exclusive network drivers.
