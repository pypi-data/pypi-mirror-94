    This change updates the multiple-nics and multiple-nics-vlans templates so
    that an external bridge is created if either the role uses the External
    network or the "external_bridge" tag is set in the role definition. This
    is done instead of checking if the role name is "Controller". This
    change also assigns the "external_bridge" tag to the Controller as well
    as the Compute roles so that both roles can access the Neutron external
    bridge for floating IPs or SNAT by default so that OVN can use DVR.
upgrade:
  - |
    The "external_bridge" tag is now used for the Compute node. An external
    network bridge is required on the compute nodes in order to host floating
    IPs when using DVR. OVN deploys with DVR by default.
