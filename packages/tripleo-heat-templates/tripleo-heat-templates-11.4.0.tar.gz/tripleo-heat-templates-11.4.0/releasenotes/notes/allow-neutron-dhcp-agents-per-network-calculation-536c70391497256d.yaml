    NeutronDhcpAgents had a default value of 3 that, even though unused in
    practice was a bad default value. Changing the default value to a
    sentinel value and making the hiera conditional allows deploy-time
    logic in puppet to provide a default value based on the number of dhcp
    agents being deployed.
