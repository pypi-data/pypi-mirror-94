  - If docker-puppet.py fails on any config_volume, it can be difficult to
    reproduce the failure given all the other entries in docker-puppet.json.
    Often to reproduce a single failure, one has to modify the json file, and
    remove all other entries, save the result to a new file, then pass that new
    file as $CONFIG. The ability to specify $CONFIG_VOLUME, which will cause
    docker-puppet.py to only run the configuration for the specified entry in
    docker-puppet.json whose config_volume value matches the user specified
    value has been added.
