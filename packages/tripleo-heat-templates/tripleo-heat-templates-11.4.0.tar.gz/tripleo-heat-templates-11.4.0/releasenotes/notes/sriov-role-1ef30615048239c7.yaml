    A new role ComputeSriov has been added to the roles definition to create
    a compute with SR-IOV capabilities. The SR-IOV services has been removed
    from the default Compute role, so that a cluster can have general Compute
    along with ComputeSriov roles.

    If a existing cluster has enabled SR-IOV with Compute role, then the
    service OS::TripleO::Services::NeutronSriovAgent has to be added to the
    Compute role in their roles_data.yaml. If the existing cluster has created
    SR-IOV role as a custom role (other than Compute), then this change will
    not affect.
