   Instance create fails due to wrong default secontext with NFS

   With NovaNfsEnabled instance create fails due to wrong default
   secontext. The default in THT is set to nova_var_lib_t in
   Ie4fe217bd119b638f42c682d21572547f02f17b2 while
   system_u:object_r:nfs_t:s0 should have access. The virt_use_nfs
   boolean, which is turned on by openstack-selinux, should cover
   this use case.

   This changes the default to context=system_u:object_r:nfs_t:s0
