    Deployment with enabled NFS share for nova ephemeral storage fails. Podman
    fails to relable with mounted nfs in /var/lib/nova/instances and container
    fail to start with "operation not supported".
    This change only sets the z flag for the /var/lib/nova in case nfs is not
    enabled for the compute.
