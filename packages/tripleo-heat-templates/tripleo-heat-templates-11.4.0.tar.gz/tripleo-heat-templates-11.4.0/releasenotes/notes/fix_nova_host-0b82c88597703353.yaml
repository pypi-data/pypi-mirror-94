    The nova/neutron/ceilometer host parameter is now explicitly set to the
    same value that is written to /etc/hosts. On a correctly configured
    deployment they should be already be identical. However if the hostname
    or domainname is altered (e.g via DHCP) then the hostname is unlikely to
    resolve to the correct IP address for live-migraiton.
