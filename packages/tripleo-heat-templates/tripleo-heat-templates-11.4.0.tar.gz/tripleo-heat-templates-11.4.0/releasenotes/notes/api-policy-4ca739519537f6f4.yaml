    TripleO is now able to configure role-based access API policies with new
    parameters for each API service.
    For example, Nova API service has now NovaApiPolicies and the value
    could be { nova-context_is_admin: { key: context_is_admin, value: 'role:admin' } }
    It will configure /etc/nova/policy.json file and configure context_is_admin
    to true. Puppet will take care of this configuration and API services are
    restarted when the file is touched.
    We're also adding augeas resource to the list of Puppet providers that
    container deployments grab in the catalog to generate configurations, so
    this feature can be used when deploying TripleO in containers.
