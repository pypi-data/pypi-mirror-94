    For deployments running on RHEL with Satellite 6 (or beyond) with Capsule (Katello API enabled),
    the Katello API is available on 8443 port, so the previous API ping didn't work for this case.
    Capsule is now supported since we just check if katello-ca-consumer-latest rpm is available
    to tell that Satellite version is 6 or beyond.
