features:
  -
    Enhance lb-mgmt-subnet to be a class B subnet, so the global amount
    of Octavia loadbalancers won't be constrained to a very low number.
upgrade:
  -
    This fix is changing the default mask for lb-mgmt-subnet.
    Operators can either manually modify the already existing subnet or create
    a new one and update Octavia to use it. Newly create loadbalancer will use
    The newly created subnet.
