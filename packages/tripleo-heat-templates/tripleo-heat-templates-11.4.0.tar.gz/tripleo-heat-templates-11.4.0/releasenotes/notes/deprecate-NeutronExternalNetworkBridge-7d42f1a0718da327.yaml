upgrade:
  - The ``NeutronExternalNetworkBridge`` parameter changed its default value
    from ``br-ex`` to an empty string value. It means that by default Neutron
    L3 agent will be able to serve multiple external networks. (It was always
    the case for those who were using templates with the value of the parameter
    overridden by an empty string value.)
deprecations:
  - The ``NeutronExternalNetworkBridge`` parameter is deprecated and will be
    removed in a next release.
