features:
  - Introduce the ability to deploy the qpid-dispatch-router (Qdr) for
    the oslo.messaging AMQP 1.0 driver backend. The Qdr provides
    direct messaging (e.g. brokerless) communications for
    oslo.messaging services. To facilitate simple use for evaluation
    in an overcloud deployment, the Qdr aliases the RabbitMQ service
    to provide the messaging backend.
