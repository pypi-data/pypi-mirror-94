features:
  - Named debug ansible tasks have been added to the plays that get generated
    in deploy_steps_playbook.yaml (from common/deploy-steps.j2). The explicitly
    named tasks allow for using ansible-playbook's --start-at-task option to
    resume a deployment from the start of a given play.
