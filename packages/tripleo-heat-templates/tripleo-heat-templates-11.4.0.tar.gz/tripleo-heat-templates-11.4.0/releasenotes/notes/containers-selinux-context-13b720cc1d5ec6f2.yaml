    The configuration management related directories managed by the
    tripleo deployment tools and bind-mounted as docker volumes now
    using the `:z` flag, which is a docker's equivalent for
    `chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t -l s0`. This makes those
    directories available for all containers on the host, in the
    shared mode: `/var/lib/tripleo-config`, `/var/lib/docker-puppet`,
    `/var/lib/kolla/config`, `/etc/puppet`,
    `/usr/share/openstack-puppet/modules/`, `/var/lib/config-data`.

    Allow containerized services to be executed on hosts with SELinux
    in the enforcing mode.
