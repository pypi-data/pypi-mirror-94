features:
  - |
    Add new TunedCustomProfile parameter which may contain a string
    in INI format describing a custom tuned profile. Also provide a
    new environment file for users of hypercoverged Ceph deployments
    using the Ceph filestore storage backened. The tuned profile is
    based on heavy I/O load testing. The provided environment file
    creates /etc/tuned/ceph-filestore-osd-hci/tuned.conf and sets
    this tuned profile to be active. Not intended for use with Ceph
    bluestore.
fixes:
  - |
    CephOSD/Compute nodes crash under memory pressure unless custom tuned profile is used
