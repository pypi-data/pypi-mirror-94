upgrade:
  - With expirer deprecated and disabled by default, there is an upgrade
    impact here. If you had expirer enabled in ocata and you upgrade to
    pike the expirer will not be enabled anymore. If you wish to use
    expirer, ensure you include the ceilometer-expirer.yaml
    to your upgrade deploy command. Also note that with collector
    disabled, there is no need for expirer to be running.
deprecations:
  - Deprecate and turn off expirer service as collector. Without collector
    and standard storage, expirer has no use.
