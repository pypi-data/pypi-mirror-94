features:
  -  Allows a deployer to specify the IdM domain with --domain on the
     ipa-client-install invocation by providing the IdMDomain parameter.
  -  Allows a deployer to direct the ipa-client-install to skip NTP setup
     by specifying the IdMNoNtpSetup parameter.  This is useful if the
     ipa-client-install setup clobbers the NTP setup by puppet.
