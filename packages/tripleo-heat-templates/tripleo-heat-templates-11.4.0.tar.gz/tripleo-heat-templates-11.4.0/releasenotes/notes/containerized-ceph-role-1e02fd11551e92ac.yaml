    With the move to containers, Ceph OSDs may be combined with other
    Ceph services and dedicated Ceph monitors on controllers may be
    used less. Popular Ceph roles which include OSDs are Ceph file,
    object and nodes which run all Ceph services. This pattern also
    applies to Hyper Converged (HCI) roles. The following pre-composed
    roles have been added to make it easier to deploy in this pattern.
    - CephAll: Standalone Storage Full Role
    - CephFile: Standalone Scale-out File Role
    - CephObject: Standalone Scale-out Object Role
    - HciCephAll: HCI Full Stack Role
    - HciCephFile: HCI Scale-out File Role
    - HciCephObject: HCI Scale-out Object Role
    - HciCephMon: HCI Scale-out Block Full Role
    - ControllerNoCeph: OpenStack Controller without any Ceph Services
