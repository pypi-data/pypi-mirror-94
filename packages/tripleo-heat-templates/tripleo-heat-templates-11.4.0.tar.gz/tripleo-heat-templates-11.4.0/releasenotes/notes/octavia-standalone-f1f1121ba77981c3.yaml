    Octavia may be deployed for a standalone cloud, which has yet Nova services
    available for Amphorae SSH keys management. For that case, the parameter
    ``OctaviaAmphoraSshKeyFile`` must be defined by a user.
    Otherwise, it takes an empty value by usual for overcloud deployments
    meanings and Nova will be used to create a key-pair for Octavia instead.
