    As ceph-dashboard is available on Ceph, the new ceph dashboard composable
    service enables a user scenario in which the dashboard is deployed along
    with the other ceph components using TripleO.
    This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by operators adding
    to the deployment the ceph-dashboard.yaml environment file included
    in tripleo-heat-templates.
