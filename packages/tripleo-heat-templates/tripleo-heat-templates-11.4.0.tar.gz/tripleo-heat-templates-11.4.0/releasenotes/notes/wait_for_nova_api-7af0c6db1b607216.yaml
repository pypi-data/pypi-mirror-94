    If nova-api is delayed starting then the nova_wait_for_compute_service
    can timeout. A deployment using a slow/busy remote container repository is
    particularly susceptible to this issue. To resolve this nova_compute and
    nova_wait_for_compute_service have been postponed to step_5 and a task
    has been added to step_4 to ensure nova_api is active before proceeding.
    Resolves Bug `1842948 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1842948>`_.
