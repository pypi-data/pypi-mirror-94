    Containers are now the default way of deploying. There is still a way to
    deploy the baremetal services in environments/baremetal-services.yaml, but
    this is expected to eventually disappear.
upgrade:
  - |
    Environment files originally referenced from `environments/services-docker`
    should be altered to the `environments/services` paths. If some of the
    deployed baremetal services need to be retained as non-containerized,
    update its references to `environments/services-baremetal` instead of
    `environments/services`.

    .. note:: Starting from Rocky, overcloud upgrades to baremetal services
      (non-containerized), or mixed services is no more tested nor verified.
