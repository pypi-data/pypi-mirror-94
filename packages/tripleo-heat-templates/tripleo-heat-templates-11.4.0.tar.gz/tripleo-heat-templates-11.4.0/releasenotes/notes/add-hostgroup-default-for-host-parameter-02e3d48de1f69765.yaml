fixes:
  - Set "host" parameter in manila.conf to 'hostgroup' when running
    manila share service under pacemaker.  This labels instances of
    the service on different nodes with the same "host" as cinder does
    in this circumstance so that the instances are considered by
    OpenStack to provide the same service and manila share is able to
    maintain management of shares on the backend after failover and
    failback.
