deprecations:
  - The use of outputs with Heat SoftwareConfig or StructuredConfig resources
    is now deprecated as they are no longer supported with config-download.
    Resources that depend on outputs and their values should be changed to use
    composable services with external_deploy_tasks or deploy_steps_tasks.
