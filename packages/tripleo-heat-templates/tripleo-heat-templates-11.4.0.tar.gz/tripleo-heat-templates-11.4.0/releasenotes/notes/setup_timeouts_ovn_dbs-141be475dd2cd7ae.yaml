    Under pressure, the default monitor timeout value of 20 seconds is not
    enough to prevent unnecessary failovers of the ovn-dbs pacemaker resource.
    While spawning a few VMs in the same time this could lead to unnecessary
    movements of master DB, then re-connections of ovn-controllers (slaves are
    read-only), further peaks of load on DBs, and at the end it could lead to
    snowball effect. Now this value can be configurable by
    OVNDBSPacemakerTimeout which will configure
    tripleo::profile::pacemaker::ovn_dbs_bundle (default is set to 60s).
