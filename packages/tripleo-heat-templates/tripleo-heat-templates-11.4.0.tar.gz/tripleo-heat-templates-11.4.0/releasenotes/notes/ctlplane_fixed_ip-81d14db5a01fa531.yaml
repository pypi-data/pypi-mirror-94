    Add ability to specify a fixed IP for the provisioning control plane
    (ctlplane) network. This works similarly to the existing fixed IPs
    for isolated networks, by including an environment file which includes
    an IP for each node in each role that should use a fixed IP. An example
    environment file is included in environments/ips-from-pool-ctlplane.yaml.
