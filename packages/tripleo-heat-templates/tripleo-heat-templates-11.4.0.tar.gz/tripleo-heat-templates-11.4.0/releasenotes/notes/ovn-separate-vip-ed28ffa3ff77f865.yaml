    This change (with its dependent reviews) creates a separate VIP for the OVN DBS
    service. A more detailed explanation can be found in https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1841811.
    The short explanation is that the OVN DBS HA service puts some additional constraints on the VIP it
    uses and that is problematic when that VIP is used by other services (e.g. a change in OVN DBS master
    will move the VIP and will also reset all mysql connections. It also prevents us splitting OVN DBS from
    where haproxy runs).
