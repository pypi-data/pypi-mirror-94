    Added the configuration option to set reserved_huge_pages.
    When NovaReservedHugePages is set, "reserved_huge_pages" is set to the
    value of NovaReservedHugePages. If NovaReservedHugePages is unset and
    OvsDpdkSocketMemory is set, reserved_huge_pages value is calcuated from
    KernelArgs and OvsDpdkSocketMemory. KernelArgs helps determine the
    default huge page size used, the default is set to 2048kb and
    OvsDpdkSocketMemory helps determine the number of hugepages to reserve.
