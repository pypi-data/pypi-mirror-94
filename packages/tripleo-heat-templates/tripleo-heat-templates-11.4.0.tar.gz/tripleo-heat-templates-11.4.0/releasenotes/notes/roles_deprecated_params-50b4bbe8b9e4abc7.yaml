deprecations:
  - |
    The static role definitions contained a number of conflicting parameters
    which require special handling to convert to dynamic template generation.
    In the future, these parameters will be removed. If a role requires one
    of these deprecated parameters, then it will be defined in the role
    definition in a property named "deprecated_param_<name>". If the role has one
    or more deprecated parameters, then "uses_deprecated_params" should be
    set to True as well. This will enable creation of a parameter_group
    containing the deprecated parameters in the role definition, which will enable
    warning users if they use deprecated parameters on deployment.

    For deployments where a custom roles_data file is used, it should be rebased
    against the default roles_data.yaml, as several additional items, e.g to
    specify deprecated parameter names for some of the default roles, have been
    added.  Alternatively you can regenerate your roles_data using the new 
    overcloud roles generate command, so that the updated role definitions in
    /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/roles are used, which include
    the necessary additional data.
