    The previous installation method for the undercloud installed some extra
    OpenStack clients during the installation. Since we did not have an
    equivalent way in the containerized version of the undercloud,
    we've added a new TripleO 'service' to install all of the OpenStack
    clients on a system. OS::TripleO::Services::OpenStackClients has been
    added which can be added to a custom role to install the clients. By
    default, only the Undercloud and Standalone roles will have this
    available.
