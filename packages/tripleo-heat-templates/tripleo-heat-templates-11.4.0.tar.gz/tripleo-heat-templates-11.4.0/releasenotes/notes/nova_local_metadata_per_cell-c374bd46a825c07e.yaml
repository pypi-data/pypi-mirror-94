    Adds NovaLocalMetadataPerCell cell support, default false.
    Indicates that the nova-metadata API service has been deployed
    per-cell, so that we can have better performance and data isolation
    in a multi-cell deployment. Users should consider the use of this
    configuration depending on how neutron is setup. If networks span
    cells, you might need to run nova-metadata API service globally.
    If your networks are segmented along cell boundaries, then you can
    run nova-metadata API service per cell.
