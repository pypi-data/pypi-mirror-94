features:
  - |
    ``ContainerCli`` allows 'docker' (deprecated) and 'podman' for Neutron
    L3/DHCP and OVN metadata rootwrap containers managed by agents.
    Parameters ``OVNWrapperDebug`` and  ``NeutronWrapperDebug`` (Defaults to
    `False`) allow to log debug messages for the wrapper scripts managing
    rootwrap containers. It is also controled by the global ``Debug`` setting.
fixes:
  - |
    Neutron/OVN rootwrap containers are managed by agents and will no longer
    be deleted, when the parent container restarts.
deprecations:
  - |
    Parameter ``DockerAdditionalSockets`` is deprecated. No sockets are
    expected to bind mount for podman. So it only works for the docker runtime.
