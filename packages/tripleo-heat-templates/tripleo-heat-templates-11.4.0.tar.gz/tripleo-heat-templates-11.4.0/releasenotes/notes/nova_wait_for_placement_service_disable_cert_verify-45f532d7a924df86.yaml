    With tls-everywhere enabled connecting to keystone endpoint fails
    to retrieve the URL for the placement endpoint as the certificate
    can not be verified. While verification is disabled to check the 
    placement endpoint later, it is not to communicate with keystone.
    This disables certificate verification for communication with
    keystone.
