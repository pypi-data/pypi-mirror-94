    Certain nova containers require more locked memory that the default limit of 16KiB.
    Increase the default memlock to 64MiB via ``DockerNovaComputeUlimit``.

    As this is only a maximum limit and not a pre-allocatiosn this will not
    increase the memory requirements for all nova containers.  To date the only
    container to require this is nova_cell_v2_discover_hosts which is short lived.
