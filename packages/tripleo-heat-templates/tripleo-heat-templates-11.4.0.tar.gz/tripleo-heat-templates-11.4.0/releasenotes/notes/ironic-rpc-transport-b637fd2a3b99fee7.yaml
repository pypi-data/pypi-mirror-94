    `IronicRpcTransport` controlls the remote procedure call transport between
    Ironic Conductor and API processes. For some case, like Edge DCN, this
    parameter may be set to 'json-rpc', when the used messaging broker should
    not be stretched over WAN. For such cases, this option also plays nicely
    alongside the
    `Ironic Conductor Groups <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/conductor-groups.html>`_
    feature. Defaults to an empty value, which leaves the corresponding
    service's default value intact.
