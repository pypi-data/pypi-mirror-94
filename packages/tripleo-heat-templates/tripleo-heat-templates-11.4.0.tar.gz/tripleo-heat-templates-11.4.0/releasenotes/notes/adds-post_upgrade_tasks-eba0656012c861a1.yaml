upgrade:
  - |
    This adds post_upgrade_tasks, ansible tasks that can be added to any
    service manifest (currently, pacemaker/cinder-volume for bug 1706951).

    These are similar to the existing upgrade_tasks in their format, however
    they will be executed *after* the docker/puppet config. So the order is
    upgrade_tasks, deployment steps (docker/puppet), then post_upgrade_tasks.

    Also like the upgrade_tasks these are serialised and you can use 'tags'
    with 'step0' to 'step6' (more can be added if needed).
