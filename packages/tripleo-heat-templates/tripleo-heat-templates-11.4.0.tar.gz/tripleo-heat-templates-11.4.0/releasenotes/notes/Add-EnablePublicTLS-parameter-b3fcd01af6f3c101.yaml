    This adds a flag called EnablePublicTLS, which defaults to 'true'. It
    reflects that Public TLS is enabled by default, and it's read by
    the deployment workflow to let the public certificate generation happen.
    It can also be used to disable this feature, if it's set to 'false' as
    it's done in the no-tls-endpoints-public-ip.yaml environment
    file, which allows deployers to turn this feature off.
