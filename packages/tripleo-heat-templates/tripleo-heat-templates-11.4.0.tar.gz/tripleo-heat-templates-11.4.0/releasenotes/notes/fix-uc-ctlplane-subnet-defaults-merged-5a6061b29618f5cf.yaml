    Fixes an issue that caused a subnet to be wrongly created on the Undercloud
    provisioning network based on environment default values. If the default
    ``ctlplane-subnet`` was renamed in ``undercloud.conf``, the defaults for
    ``ctlplane-subnet`` in ``environments/undercloud.yaml`` was merged with the
    subnets defined in ``undercloud.conf``. See `bug 1820330
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1820330>`_.
