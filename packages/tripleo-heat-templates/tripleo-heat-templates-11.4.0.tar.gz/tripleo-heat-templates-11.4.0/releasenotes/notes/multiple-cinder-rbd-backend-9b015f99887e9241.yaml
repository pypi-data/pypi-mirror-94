    Add new CinderRbdExtraPools Heat parameter, which specifies a list of
    Ceph pools for use with RBD backends for Cinder. An extra Cinder RBD
    backend driver is created for each pool in the list. This is in addition
    to the standard RBD backend driver associated with the CinderRbdPoolName.
    The new parameter is optional, and defaults to an empty list. All of the
    pools are associated with a single Ceph cluster.
