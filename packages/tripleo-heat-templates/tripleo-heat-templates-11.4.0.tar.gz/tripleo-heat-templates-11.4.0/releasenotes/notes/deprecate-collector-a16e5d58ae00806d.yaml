upgrade:
  - With collector deprecated and disabled by default, there is an upgrade
    impact here. If you had collector enabled in ocata and you upgrade to
    pike the collector will not be enabled anymore. If you wish to use
    collector, ensure you include the ceilometer-collector.yaml
    to your upgrade deploy command. We recommend switching to using the
    new pipeline approach with publisher instead.
deprecations:
  - Deprecate and disable ceilometer collector service by default. Instead
    use the publisher directly in the pipeline to push data where appropriate.
    This can be manually enabled by passing the environment file to deploy
    command which is included in environment dir as ceilometer-collector.yaml.
    By default, the pipeline publisher pushes data automatically to gnocchi.
