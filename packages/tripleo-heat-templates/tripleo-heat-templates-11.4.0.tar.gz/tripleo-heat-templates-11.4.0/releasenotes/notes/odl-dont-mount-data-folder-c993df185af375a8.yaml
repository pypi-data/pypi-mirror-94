    /opt/opendaylight/data folder is mounted on host. This folder
    contains information about installed features in ODL. Mounting
    this folder on container makes ODL believe that features are
    installed and it doesnot generate required for proper boot. Thus
    this folder is no longer mounted to host so that ODL can boot
    properly on restart.
