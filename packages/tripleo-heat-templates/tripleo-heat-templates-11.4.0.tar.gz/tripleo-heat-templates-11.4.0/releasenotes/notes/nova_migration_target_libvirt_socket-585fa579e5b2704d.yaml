    https://review.opendev.org/#/c/662109/ removed the bind mount from /run
    inside the nova_migration_target container. But the nova-migration-wrapper
    inside the container needs access to the libvirt socket -
    https://github.com/rdo-packages/nova-distgit/blob/rpm-master/nova-migration-wrapper#L31 .
    This adds the bind mount of /run/libvirt to the nova_migration_target
    container to fix live migration issues.
