    Certificates get merged into the containers using kolla_config
    mechanism. If a certificate changes, or e.g. UseTLSTransportForNbd
    gets disabled and enabled at a later point the containers running
    the qemu process miss the required certificates and live migration
    fails.
    This change moves to use bind mount for the certificates and in
    case of UseTLSTransportForNbd ans creates the required certificates even
    if UseTLSTransportForNbd is set to False. With this UseTLSTransportForNbd
    can be enabled/disabled as the required bind mounts/certificates
    are already present.
