# ezomero
A module with convenience functions for writing Python code that interacts with OMERO.


# Installation

Just `pip install ezomero` and you should be good to go! The repo contains a `requirements.txt` file with the specific package versions we test `ezomero` with, but any Python>=3.6 and latest `omero-py` and `numpy` _should_ work -  note that this package is in active development!

# Usage

In general, you will need to create a `BlitzGateway` object using `omero-py`, successfully do something like `conn.connect()` and then pass the `conn` object to most of these helper functions along with function-specific parameters.
