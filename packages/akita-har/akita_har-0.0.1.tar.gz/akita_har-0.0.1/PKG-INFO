Description: # Akita HTTP Archive (HAR) Utility
        
        This package provides Pydantic models for HTTP Archive (HAR) files, along with
        a thread-safe file-writer for creating and concurrently writing HAR entries.
        
        ## See it in Action
        
        Take a look at the [Akita Django
        Integration](https://github.com/akitasoftware/akita-django), which extends the
        `django.test.Client` to produce a HAR file containing requests and responses
        from Django integration tests.
