            candidate paths. Beware, order does matter, the first extension
            will be the top candidate.
        STRICT_PATH_VALIDATION (bool): A switch to enabled (``True``) or
            disable (``False``) exception raising when a path can not be

        Note:
            Resolving strategy is made like libsass do, meaning paths in
            import rules are resolved from the source file where the import
            rules have been finded.

            If import rule is not explicit enough and two file are candidates
            for the same rule, it will raises an error. But contrary to
            libsass, this happen also for files from given libraries in
            ``library_paths`` (opposed to libsass just silently taking the
            first candidate).
