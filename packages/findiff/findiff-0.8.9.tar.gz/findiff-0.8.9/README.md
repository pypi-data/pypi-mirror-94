```

## Derivatives

_findiff_ works in any number of dimensions. But for the sake of demonstration, suppose you
want to differentiate a four-dimensional function given on a 4D array `f` with coordinates `x, y, z, u`.

For <img src="docs/frontpage/d_dx.png" alt="d_dx" height="30"/>, where <i>x</i> denotes the 0-th axis, we can write

```python
# define operator
d_dx = FinDiff(0, dx)

# apply operator
df_dx = d_dx(f)
# df_dx is now an array of the same shape as f containing the partial derivative
```
The partial derivative <img src="docs/frontpage/d_dz.png" alt="d_dz" height="30"/>, where <i>z</i> means the 2nd axis, is

```python
d_dz = FinDiff(2, dz)
df_dz = d_dz(f)
```

Higher derivatives like
<img src="docs/frontpage/d2_dx2.png" alt="d2_dx2" height="30"/>  or <img src="docs/frontpage/d4_dy4.png" alt="d4_dy4" height="30"/>
can be defined like this:

```python
# the derivative order is the third argument
d2_dx2 = FinDiff(0, dx, 2)
d2f_dx2 = d2_dx2(f)

d4_dy4 = FinDiff(1, dy, 4)
d4f_dy4 = d4_dy4(f)
```

Mixed partial derivatives like 
<img src="docs/frontpage/d2_dxdz.png" alt="d2_dxdz" height="30"/> or 
<img src="docs/frontpage/d3_dx2dz.png" alt="d3_dx2dz" height="30"/>


```python
d2_dxdz = FinDiff((0, dx), (2, dz))
d2_dxdz(f)

d3_dx2dz = FinDiff((0, dx, 2), (2, dz))
```

Linear combinations of differential operators like

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/frontpage/var_coef.png" alt="variableCoefficients" height="40"/>
</p>

can be written as

```python
from numpy import meshgrid, sin
X, Y, Z, U = meshgrid(x, y, z, u, indexing="ij")
diff_op = Coef(2*X) * FinDiff((0, dz, 2), (2, dz, 1)) + Coef(3*sin(Y)*Z**2) * FinDiff((0, dx, 1), (1, dy, 2))
```

Chaining differential operators is also possible, e.g.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/frontpage/chaining.png" alt="chaining" height="40"/>
</p>

```python
diff_op = (FinDiff(0, dx) - FinDiff(1, dy)) * (FinDiff(0, dx) + FinDiff(1, dy))
# is equivalent to
diff_op2 = FinDiff(0, dx, 2) - FinDiff(1, dy, 2)
```

Standard operators from vector calculus like gradient, divergence and curl are also available, for example:

```python
grad = Gradient(h=[dx, dy, dz, du])
grad_f = grad(f)
```

More examples can be found [here](https://maroba.github.io/findiff-docs/source/examples.html) and in [this blog](https://computing-blog.com).


### Derivatives in N dimensions

The package can work with any number of dimensions, the generalization
of usage is straight forward. The only limit is memory and CPU speed.

### Accuracy Control

When constructing an instance of `FinDiff`, you can request the desired accuracy
order by setting the keyword argument `acc`. 

```
d2_dx2 = findiff.FinDiff(0, dy, 2, acc=4)
d2f_dx2 = d2_dx2(f)
```

If not specified, second order accuracy will be taken by default.


### Finite Difference Coefficients

Sometimes you may want to have the raw finite difference coefficients.
These can be obtained for __any__ derivative and accuracy order
using `findiff.coefficients(deriv, acc)`. For instance,

```python
import findiff
coefs = findiff.coefficients(deriv=2, acc=2)
```

gives

```
{ 'backward': {'coefficients': array([-1.,  4., -5.,  2.]),
               'offsets': array([-3, -2, -1,  0])},
  'center': {'coefficients': array([ 1., -2.,  1.]),
             'offsets': array([-1,  0,  1])},
  'forward': {'coefficients': array([ 2., -5.,  4., -1.]),
              'offsets': array([0, 1, 2, 3])}
              }
```

FinDiff operators will use central coefficients whenever possible and switch
to backward or forward coefficients if not enough points are available on either side.

If you need exact values instead of floating point numbers, you
can request a symbolic solution, e.g.

```python
import findiff
coefs = findiff.coefficients(deriv=3, acc=4, symbolic=True)
```

gives

```
{'backward': {'coefficients': [15/8, -13, 307/8, -62, 461/8, -29, 49/8],
              'offsets': [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0]},
 'center': {'coefficients': [1/8, -1, 13/8, 0, -13/8, 1, -1/8],
            'offsets': [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]},
 'forward': {'coefficients': [-49/8, 29, -461/8, 62, -307/8, 13, -15/8],
             'offsets': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}}
```

If you want to specify the detailed offsets instead of the
accuracy order, you can do this by setting the offset keyword
argument:

```python
import findiff
coefs = findiff.coefficients(deriv=2, offsets=[-2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 7], symbolic=True)
```

The resulting accuracy order is computed and part of the output:

```
{'coefficients': [187/1620, -122/27, 9/7, 103/20, -13/5, 31/54, -19/2835], 
 'offsets': [-2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 7], 
 'accuracy': 5}
```

### Matrix Representation

For a given _FinDiff_ differential operator, you can get the matrix representation 
using the `matrix(shape)` method, e.g.

```python
x = [np.linspace(0, 6, 7)]
d2_dx2 = FinDiff(0, x[1]-x[0], 2)
u = x**2

mat = d2_dx2.matrix(u.shape)  # this method returns a scipy sparse matrix
print(mat.toarray())
``` 

has the output

```
[[ 2. -5.  4. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 1. -2.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1. -2.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  1. -2.  1.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  1. -2.  1.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  1. -2.  1.]
 [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  4. -5.  2.]]
```

The same works for differential operators in higher dimensions. Of course, you can
use this matrix to perform the differentiation manually by matrix-vector multiplication:

```python
d2u_dx2 = mat.dot(u.reshape(-1))
```

Examples using the matrix representation like solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation can be found
in this [blog](https://computing-blog.com/2020/09/05/schroedinger-in-3-lines/).

### Stencils

You can also take a look at the finite difference stencils, e.g. for a 2D grid:

```python
import numpy as np
from findiff import FinDiff

x, y = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='ij')
u = X**3 + Y**3
laplace_2d = FinDiff(0, x[1]-x[0], 2) + FinDiff(1, y[1]-y[0], 2)

stencil = laplace_2d.stencil(u.shape)

print(stencil)
```

yields the following output

```
('L', 'L'):	{(0, 0): 4.0, (1, 0): -5.0, (2, 0): 4.0, (3, 0): -1.0, (0, 1): -5.0, (0, 2): 4.0, (0, 3): -1.0}
('L', 'C'):	{(0, 0): 0.0, (1, 0): -5.0, (2, 0): 4.0, (3, 0): -1.0, (0, -1): 1.0, (0, 1): 1.0}
('L', 'H'):	{(0, 0): 4.0, (1, 0): -5.0, (2, 0): 4.0, (3, 0): -1.0, (0, -3): -1.0, (0, -2): 4.0, (0, -1): -5.0}
('C', 'L'):	{(-1, 0): 1.0, (0, 0): 0.0, (1, 0): 1.0, (0, 1): -5.0, (0, 2): 4.0, (0, 3): -1.0}
('C', 'C'):	{(-1, 0): 1.0, (0, 0): -4.0, (1, 0): 1.0, (0, -1): 1.0, (0, 1): 1.0}
('C', 'H'):	{(-1, 0): 1.0, (0, 0): 0.0, (1, 0): 1.0, (0, -3): -1.0, (0, -2): 4.0, (0, -1): -5.0}
('H', 'L'):	{(-3, 0): -1.0, (-2, 0): 4.0, (-1, 0): -5.0, (0, 0): 4.0, (0, 1): -5.0, (0, 2): 4.0, (0, 3): -1.0}
('H', 'C'):	{(-3, 0): -1.0, (-2, 0): 4.0, (-1, 0): -5.0, (0, 0): 0.0, (0, -1): 1.0, (0, 1): 1.0}
('H', 'H'):	{(-3, 0): -1.0, (-2, 0): 4.0, (-1, 0): -5.0, (0, 0): 4.0, (0, -3): -1.0, (0, -2): 4.0, (0, -1): -5.0}
```

This is a dictionary with the characteristic points as keys and the stencils as values. 
The 2D grid has 3**2 = 9 "characteristic points", so it has 9 stencils.

'L' stands for 'lowest index' (which is 0), 'H' for 'highest index' (which is the number of points on the given axis minus 1)
and 'C' for 'center', i.e. a grid point not at the boundary of the axis.

In 2D the characteristic points are center points ('C', 'C'), corner points: ('L', 'L'), ('L', 'H'), ('H', 'L'), ('H', 'H')
and edge-points (all others). For N > 2 dimensions the characteristic points are 3**N analogous tuples with N indices each.

Each stencil is a dictionary itself with the index offsets as keys and the finite difference coefficients as values.

In order to apply the stencil manually, you can use

```
lap_u = stencil.apply_all(u)
``` 

which iterates over all grid points, selects the right right stencil and applies it.

## Partial Differential Equations

_findiff_ can be used to easily formulate and solve partial differential equation problems

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/frontpage/img-db2705be98d985e0.png" height="20"/>
</p>

where _L_ is a general linear differential operator.
 
In order to obtain a unique solution,  Dirichlet, Neumann or more general boundary conditions
can be applied.

### Boundary Value Problems

</p>


```python
from findiff import FinDiff, Id, PDE

shape = (300, )
t = numpy.linspace(0, 10, shape[0])
dt = t[1]-t[0]

L = FinDiff(0, dt, 2) - FinDiff(0, dt, 1) + Coef(5) * Id()
f = numpy.cos(2*t)

bc = BoundaryConditions(shape)
bc[0] = 0
bc[-1] = 1

pde = PDE(L, f, bc)
u = pde.solve()
```

dx, dy = x[1]-x[0], y[1]-y[0]
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='ij')

L = FinDiff(0, dx, 2) + FinDiff(1, dy, 2)
f = np.zeros(shape)

bc = BoundaryConditions(shape)
bc[1,:] = FinDiff(0, dx, 1), 0  # Neumann BC
bc[-1,:] = 300. - 200*Y   # Dirichlet BC
bc[:, 0] = 300.   # Dirichlet BC
bc[1:-1, -1] = FinDiff(1, dy, 1), 0  # Neumann BC

pde = PDE(L, f, bc)
u = pde.solve()
```

Result:
