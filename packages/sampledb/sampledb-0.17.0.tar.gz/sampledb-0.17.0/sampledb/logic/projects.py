Logic module for user managed projects

Users can create uniquely named projects and use them to more easily manage
permissions for samples or measurements. Users with GRANT permissions for a
project can add new users and manage other users' permissions.

When a project is given permissions for an object, users will get whatever
level of permissions is lower: the project's object permissions or the user's
project permissions. Same is true for a group.

This module provides a procedural interface to the underlying database model,
with the immutable Project class accessible to the developer instead of an
SQLAlchemy ORM class.

As the project models use flask-sqlalchemy however, the functions in this
module should be called from within a Flask application context.
