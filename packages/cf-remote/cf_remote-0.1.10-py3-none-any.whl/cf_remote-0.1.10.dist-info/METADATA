# cf-remote

`cf-remote` is a tool to deploy CFEngine.
It works by contacting remote hosts with SSH and using `ssh` / `scp` to copy files and run commands.
Commands for provisioning hosts in the cloud (AWS or GCP) are also available.

## Requirements

cf-remote requires python 3.6 or greater.
SSH must already be configured and running on the remote host.

## Installation

Install with pip3:

```
$ pip3 install cf-remote
```

## Examples

### See information about remote host

The `info` command can be used to check basic information about a system.

```
$ cf-remote info -H 34.241.203.218

ubuntu@34.241.203.218
OS            : ubuntu (debian)
Architecture  : x86_64
CFEngine      : 3.12.1
Policy server : 172.31.42.192
Binaries      : dpkg, apt
```

(You must have ssh access).

### Installing and bootstrapping CFEngine Enterprise Hub

The `install` command can automatically download and install packages as well as bootstrap both hubs and clients.

```
cf-remote install --hub 34.247.181.100 --bootstrap 172.31.44.146 --demo

ubuntu@34.247.181.100
OS            : ubuntu (debian)
Architecture  : x86_64
CFEngine      : Not installed
Policy server : None
Binaries      : dpkg, apt

Your demo hub is ready: https://34.247.181.100/ (Username: admin, Password: password)
```

Note that this demo setup (`--demo`) is notoriously insecure.
It has default passwords and open access controls.
Don't use it in a production environment.

### Specify an SSH key

If you have more than one key in `~/.ssh` you may need to specify which key `cf-remote` is to use.

```
$ export CF_REMOTE_SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
```
