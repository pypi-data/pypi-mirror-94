  - In the parameters section of actions, the rotate_fernet_keys action was
    added. It does a rotation based on the values of the generated passwords
    or the parameter_defaults given by the user. Note that this merely does
    the rotation, deletes the excess keys and persists the new value in the plan
    environment. However, the action doesn't go to the nodes and adds the
    keys to the actual repository; that's part of a separate workflow.
