fixes:
  - The verbosity of the config-download ansible tasks now defaults to 0
    instead of 1. This makes the tasks not verbose by default. The verbosity
    specified on the command line with the deployment command is now honored
    and can be used to disable verbosity or increase the verbosity level as
    needed.
