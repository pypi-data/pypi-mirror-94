fixes:
  - The update abort command was introduced many releases ago. However, it is
    not a safe operation in the context of TripleO. The TripleO Heat stack
    could become irrepairably damage should a rollback be attempted. As such,
    it is best to remove this functionality without a deprecation period.
    The workaround for this command is to wait until the stack times out or
    completes the update.
