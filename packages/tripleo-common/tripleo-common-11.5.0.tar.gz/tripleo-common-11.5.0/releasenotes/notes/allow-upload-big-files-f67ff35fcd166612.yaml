    Allow uploading files bigger than 5GB to swift.
    Currently we have support for uploading files
    to swift using the swift client class, this class
    does not allow to upload files bigger than 5GB.
    This change enables the upload of files bigger than
    5GB by using the swift service class and adjusting
    the headers to allow this operations. This new helper
    will be used for the Undercloud backup, to be able to
    store files bigger than 5GB.
