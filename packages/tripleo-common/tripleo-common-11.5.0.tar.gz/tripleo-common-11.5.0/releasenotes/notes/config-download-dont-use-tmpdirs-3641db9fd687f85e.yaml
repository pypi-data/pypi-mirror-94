    ``openstack overcloud config download`` now writes directly to the
    directory specified by ``--config-dir``. The directory contents will be
    overwritten, preserving any contents not originating from the stack. A
    ``--no-preserve-config`` option is provided which will cause the
    ``--config-dir`` to be deleted and recreated if the``--config-dir``
    location exists. Tmpdirs are no longer used.
