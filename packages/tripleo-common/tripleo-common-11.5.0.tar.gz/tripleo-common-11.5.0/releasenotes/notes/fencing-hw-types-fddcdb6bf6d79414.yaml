fixes:
  - |
    Fixes handling hardware types (new-style Ironic drivers) when generating
    fencing parameters. Also completely removes support for no longer existing
    ``pxe_ssh`` driver.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``os_auth`` argument to the ``generate_fencing_parameters`` workflow
    is deprecated and should not be provided. It will be removed in a future
    version.
