    If the `AdditionalArchitectures` parameter has entries then the container
    image prepare will prepare images for all architectures instead of just
    the default one. A new boolean field `multi_arch` can also be set in
    `ContainerImagePrepare` entries to determine the multi arch behaviour for
    images in that entry. If any entry sets a `multi_arch` value then
    `AdditionalArchitectures` is ignored.
