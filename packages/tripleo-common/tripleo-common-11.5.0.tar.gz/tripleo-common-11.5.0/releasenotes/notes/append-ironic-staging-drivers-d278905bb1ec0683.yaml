    The ``ironic-staging-drivers`` are now installed in the ironic-conductor
    container so that these drivers can be used without rebuilding the
    container. The `Ironic Staging Drivers
    <https://ironic-staging-drivers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is used to
    hold out-of-tree Ironic drivers which doesn't have means to provide a 3rd
    Party CI at this point in time which is required by Ironic.
