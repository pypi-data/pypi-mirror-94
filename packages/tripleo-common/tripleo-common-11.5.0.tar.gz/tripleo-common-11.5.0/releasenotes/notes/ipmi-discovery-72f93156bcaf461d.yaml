    Add two new workflows for discovering IPMI BMC: ``discover_nodes`` and
    ``discover_and_enroll_nodes``.

    The former scans given IP addresses and ports, and tries to log into BMC
    using given credentials. It returns node information in a format accepted
    by the TripleO enrollment workflow.

    The latter calls the former, enrolls the resulting nodes and optionally
    moves them to manageable state.
