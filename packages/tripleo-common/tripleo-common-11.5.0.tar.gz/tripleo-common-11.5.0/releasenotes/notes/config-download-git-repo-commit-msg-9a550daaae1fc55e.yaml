features:
  - The GetOvercloudConfig action now sets a commit message that indicates the
    config was downloaded by the Mistral action and what user/project were used
    to execute the action.
  - Since the config download directory is now managed by git, the
    GetOvercloudConfig action will now first download the existing config
    container (default of overcloud-config), so that the git history is
    preserved and new changes will reuse the same git repo. Each new change to
    the config-download directory creates a new git commit.
