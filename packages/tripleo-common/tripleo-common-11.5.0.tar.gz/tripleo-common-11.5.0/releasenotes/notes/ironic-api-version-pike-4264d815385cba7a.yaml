upgrade:
  - |
    The default bare metal API version used by the overcloud was bumped
    to 1.34, which is latest API version supported by Pike ironicclient.
deprecations:
  - |
    In the Queens release ironicclient will start defaulting to the latest
    supported bare metal API version, instead of the lowest. After that,
    we will stop pinning the bare metal API version in ``overcloudrc``.
    All scripts that rely on a specific version should set it explicitly via
    either ``OS_BAREMETAL_API_VERSION`` environment variable or
    ``--os-baremetal-api-version`` command line argument.
