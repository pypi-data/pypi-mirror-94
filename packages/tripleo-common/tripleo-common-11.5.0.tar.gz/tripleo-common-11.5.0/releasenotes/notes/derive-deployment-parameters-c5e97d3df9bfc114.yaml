    Add a Mistral workflow that uses hardware introspection data to derive
    deployment parameters for features such as DPDK and HCI (hyperconverged
    Nova compute and Ceph OSD nodes). The derived parameters workflow is
    automatically invoked during deployment when the workflow is listed in
    the plan environment file.

    For each role in the deployment, the workflow analyzes the Heat resource
    tree to determine which features are relevant to that role. The main
    workflow invokes secondary workflows responsible for deriving parameters
    associated with each feature.
