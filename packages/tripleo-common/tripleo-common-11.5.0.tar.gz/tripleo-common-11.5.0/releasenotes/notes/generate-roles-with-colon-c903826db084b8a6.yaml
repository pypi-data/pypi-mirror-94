    Generating roles_data.yaml file has been enhanced to generate the defined
    roles's properties with a differnet name, so that a cluster can have
    multiple roles with same set of service, without manual edit. Adds the
    support to provide role name input as ``Compute:ComputeA`` so that the
    role ``ComputeA`` can be generated from the defined role ``Compute``, by
    only chaning the name.
