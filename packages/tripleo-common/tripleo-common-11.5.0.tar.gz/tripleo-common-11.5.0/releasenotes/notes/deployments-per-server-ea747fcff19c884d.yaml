fixes:
  - The list of pre and post deployment names generated with config-download
    are now written per server instead of per role. This change handles the
    case where a deployment may apply to only an individual or set of servers
    within a role, and not all servers in that role. host_vars are used to set
    the variable of deployment names per server instead of group_vars.
