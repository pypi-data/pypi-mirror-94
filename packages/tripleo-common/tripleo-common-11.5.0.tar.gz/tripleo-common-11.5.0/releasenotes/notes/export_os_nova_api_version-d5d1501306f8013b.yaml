    openstack cli doesn't negotiate a microversion. Live migration and
    multiattach are 2 examples of operations which require arcane incantations
    to make them work correctly, and therefore usually don't.
    This adds ``OS_COMPUTE_API_VERSION=2.latest`` to the overcloudrc file to
    fix it.
