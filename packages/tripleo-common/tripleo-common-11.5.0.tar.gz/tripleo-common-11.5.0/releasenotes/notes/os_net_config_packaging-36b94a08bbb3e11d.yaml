    Install os-net-config as an RPM package directly via DIB rather than
    rely on the os-net-config element. This change will allow us to
    deprecated further use of tripleo-image-elements for this feature.
upgrade:
  - |
    In the Ocata release we started using a tripleo-heat-templates script
    to drive os-net-config. This approach gave us better signal handling
    capabilities, reduces our dependencies on os-apply-config, and makes
    it easier to integrate and fine tune network configuration with
    for example custom mapping files. Users who have network scripts
    using the older 'os-apply-config' format will need to update
    to the new t-h-t script format as part of this change. All
    in tree templates were updated in t-h-t as part of
    git commit 2c11e9e179178d074af91d8c5c798078ac3e0966.
