    Recognizes the ``root_device`` property when enrolling nodes. We recommend
    it to be set for multi-disk nodes, but the enrolling procedure does not
    actually accept it.
  - |
    Node properties are no longer converted to strings on enrolling. This is
    not required by the Bare Metal service and may yield incorrect results.
