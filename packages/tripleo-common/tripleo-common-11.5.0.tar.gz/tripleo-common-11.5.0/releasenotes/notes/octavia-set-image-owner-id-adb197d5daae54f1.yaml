    Fixed a vulnerability where an attacker may cause new Octavia amphorae to
    run based on any arbitrary image (CVE-2019-3895).
fixes:
  - |
    Ensure [controller_worker]/amp_image_owner_id is set. This configuration
    option restricts Glance image selection to a specific owner ID. This is a
    recommended security setting.
