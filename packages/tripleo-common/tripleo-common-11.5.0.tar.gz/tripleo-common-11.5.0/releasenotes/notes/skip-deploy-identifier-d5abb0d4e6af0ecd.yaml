  - Add a new action argument, skip_deploy_identifier to DeployStackAction. The
    argument will disable setting a unique value for the DeployIdentifier
    parameter, which means the SoftwareDeployment resources in the templates
    will only be triggered if there is an actual change to their configuration.
    This argument can be used to avoid always applying configuration, such as
    during node scale out. This option should be used with Caution, and only if
    there is confidence that the software configuration does not need to be
    run, such as when scaling out certain roles.
