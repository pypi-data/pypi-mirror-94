    HeatAuthEncryptionKey, HorizonSecret, MysqlRootPassword, PcsdPassword
    and RabbitCookie are now generated by tripleo-common among other
    passwords managed by TripleO. If existing version of these parameters
    have been generated by the Heat stack we first harvest those before
    generating new version.
