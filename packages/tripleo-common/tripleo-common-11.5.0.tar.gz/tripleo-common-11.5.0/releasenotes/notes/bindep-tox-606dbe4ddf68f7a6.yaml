features:
  - The `bindep.txt` file located in the project root contains all of the
    basic required packages needed when running local tests.
  - Developers can now use bindep to list system requirements. The bindep
    command will load the list of packages for the given platform using
    the `bindep.txt` file.
  - Bindep can now be leveraged via tox using the environment **bindep**.
    This tox environment will use bindep via the `bindep-install` script
    to install any missing packages on the local system which are required
    for development purposes.
