fixes:
  - The tripleo-bootstrap ansible role will no longer fail if yum fails to
    install the required packages. This fixed behavior aligns with previous
    requirements where enabled package repositories and a working package
    manager are not required on the initially deployed images. Errors are
    ignored on the package install task, and then a subsequent task will cause
    a failure indicating the required packages are not present.
