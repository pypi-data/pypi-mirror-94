fixes:
  - When deploying a large amount of nodes, the create_admin_via_ssh workflow
    could fail due to the large amount of ansible output generated.  This patch
    updates the tripleo.ansible-playbook action in the workflow with
    trash_output:true so that the output is not saved in the mistral DB.  There
    is a log file saved already in case the output is needed for debug
    purposes.
