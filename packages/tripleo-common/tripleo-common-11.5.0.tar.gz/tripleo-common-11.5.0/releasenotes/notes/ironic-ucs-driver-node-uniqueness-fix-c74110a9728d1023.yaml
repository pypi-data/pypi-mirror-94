deprecations:

    Un-deprecated `pm_service_profile` option support at the UCS ironic
    driver.
fixes:
  - |
    Previously, ironic nodes that only differ in `pm_service_profile`
    or `ucs_service_profile` would override one another ultimately leaving
    just one of them in ironic configuration. This fix un-deprecates
    `pm_service_profile` option support at the UCS ironic driver.
