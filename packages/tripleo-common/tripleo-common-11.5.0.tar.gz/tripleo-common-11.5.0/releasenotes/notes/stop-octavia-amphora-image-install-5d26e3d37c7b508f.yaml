    Package octavia-amphora-image (RHEL) will no longer be installed by role
    octavia-undercloud, and it now installs image files in directory
    /usr/share/openstack-octavia-amphora-images/. Please ensure you have the
    latest package version installed in the undercloud node beforehand
    deploying or updating the overcloud.
