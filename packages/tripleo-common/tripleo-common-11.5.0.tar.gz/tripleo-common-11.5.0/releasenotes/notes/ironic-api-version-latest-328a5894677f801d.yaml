    The environment variables ``IRONIC_API_VERSION`` and
    ``OS_BAREMETAL_API_VERSION`` are no longer set in ``overcloudrc``.
    Starting with python-ironicclient 2.0.0 this will result in the latest
    supported API version to be used. Scripts that rely on a particular API
    version behavior must set these versions explicitly.
