=======
MyQueue
=======

MyQueue is a tool for submitting and keeping track of tasks running on a
cluster of computers. It uses SLURM_, PBS_ or LSF_ as a backend and makes
handling of tasks easy. It has a command-line interface called *mq* with a
number of sub-commands and a Python interface for managing workflows.  Simple
to set up: no system administrator or database required.

.. admonition:: Features

    * Easy task submission:

      * from the command line: ``mq submit <task> -R <cores>:<time>``
      * from Python: ``myqueue.submit(...)``

    * Automatic restarting of timed-out/out-of-memory tasks
      with more time/cores

    * Remembers your finished and failed tasks

    * Powerful *list* command for monitoring

    * Can be used together with Python *venv*\ 's

    * Folder-based Workflows

Examples
--------

Submit Python script to 32 cores for 2 hours::

    $ mq submit script.py -R 32:2h

Submit Python module *abc.run* in two folders::

    $ mq submit abc.run F1/ F2/ -R 16:30m

Check results of tasks in current folder and its sub-folders::

    $ mq list  # or mq ls
    id  folder name      res.   age     state   time    error
    --- ------ --------- ------ ------- ------- ------- ------
    117 ./     script.py 32:2h  5:28:43 TIMEOUT 2:00:03
    118 ./F1/  abc.run   16:30m 5:22:16 done      12:12
    119 ./F2/  abc.run   16:30m 5:22:16 done      17:50
    --- ------ --------- ------ ------- ------- ------- ------
    done: 2, TIMEOUT: 1, total: 3

Resubmit with more resources (1 day)::

     $ mq resubmit -i 117 -R 32:1d
