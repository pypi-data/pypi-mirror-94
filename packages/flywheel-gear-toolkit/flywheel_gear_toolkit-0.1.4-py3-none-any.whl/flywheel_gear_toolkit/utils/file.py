"""Checks if files do/don't exist, and handles exceptions.

This module is to remove the redundant "if os.path.exists...else" statements for
checking file existence. It allows you to check for a file, specify if it should or
should not exist, provide a desired extension, and determine if this file should result
in a code-stopping exception if it's not in the expected state.

Examples:
    >>> # Check to see if a file exists and has the extension '.mat'.  If it doesn't
    >>> # exist, do not raise an exception, as it's not critical to the code.
    >>> output_files = []
    >>> file_name = '/home/user/myFile.mat'
    >>> if file_state(file=file_name, ext='.mat', is_expected=True, exception_on_error=False):
    ...    output_files.append(file_name)

    >>> # Ensure that a file does not exist.  If it does, raise an exception. which will
    >>> # stop execution of the script
    >>> file_name = '/home/user/FinalOutput.csv'
    >>> file_state(file=file_name, is_expected=False, exception_on_error=True)

    Checks if a file exists as expected

    Slightly more functional 'if exists' algorithm that checks for files and takes care
    of logging.  The input options specify if the file is expected to exist or not, and
    whether an exception should be thrown if it does not match the expectation.
    Input is often from a glob or pattern match, where the extension may vary or is
    unknown, so extension matching is optional.

    Args:
        file (str, pathlib.PosixPath): The file to look for.
        ext (str): An extension that "file" must match.
        is_expected (bool): Indicate if the file should exist (True) or should not exist
            (False).
        exception_on_error (bool): Raise an exception if the file does not match the
            expectations indicated by the other input arguments.

    Returns:
        bool: Indicator of whether the file exists in the specified state
            (does or does not exist, with the specified extension).  I.E, if "file.txt"
            does not exist, and is not expected to exist, file_state returns "True".
