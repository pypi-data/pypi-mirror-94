Lino Avanti is a free `Lino <http://www.lino-framework.org/>`__
application used by social workers in East Belgium for helping
immigrants with their *integration course*.

The **integration course** is a Belgian administrative procedure
consisting in an individual mentoring and a series of courses with the
goal of helping new residents to acquire the base knowledge about
society and social relations in Belgium in order to ease their
integration on the territory.  Read more about the procedure in
